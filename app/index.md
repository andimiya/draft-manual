# 2017 Better Odds of Football Fantasy Draft Manual

Welcome to the 2017 Better Odds of Football Fantasy Draft Manual! Let’s go over quickly what we’ve got here:
- These rankings (as in the order in which players are ranked) were taken from
  - https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/rankings/consensus-cheatsheets.php
  - FantasyPros.com was utilized as it combines the rankings of over 60 experts from many fantasy football sites and platforms (including major ones like Yahoo, ESPN, CBS, etc.), and combines them to get mean rankings and averages. This is useful as we noted in our Disparity in Average Draft Position article on July 11, 2017. The rankings were pulled (and are thus the rankings on) August 7, 2017. They will surely change as weeks go on before kickoff, and we will update it as much as possible until then!

- They are meant to be analyzed in comparison to the rankings that your league has provided for your draft. Everyone else in your league sees the pre-draft rankings loaded from your host site, and the compilation rankings are a useful tool to see any bias on the part of the analysts of the site your are using. You can use this manual to really gauge value on your site vs. averaged value across many sites, and potentially get some steals in your league.
- We have organized the players into Tiers for each position. The more players in top Tiers you can get, the better chance you have of winning on a weekly basis - and that is what fantasy football is all about. You’ll need to be active on the waiver wire, etc., but laying a solid, high floor foundation for your team that still has upside is the best way to gauge fantasy success.
- IDP stats contain a value for ‘QB Hurries’ that is <5. Our data source did not inlclude anyone who had less than 5 QB Hurries on the season, and we did not want to speculate. Thus, we left it as ‘<5’.
- We omitted free agents as of 08/07/17 such as Colin Kaepernick, Corey Graham, Ladarius Green, and Robert Griffin III. We’ll try to include them immediately if they are rostered somewhere.

Best of luck to you! Feel free to direct any questions, comments, etc. to sal@betterodds.io. Here are the Tiers for each position, from offense down thru IDP. The Tiers are re-listed for each respective position chronologically in the manual. Are you ready??

## QB

**1. Aaron Rodgers - GB** Rodgers is a consistent fantasy stud who was top five in attempts (4th), yards (4th), touchdowns(1st), and passer rating (4th) last season while also completing 65.7% of his passes and only committing 11 total turnovers. His weapons in Green Bay are top tier, as Martellus Bennett and an emerging rushing attack behind Ty Montgomery are now added to the Nelson-Adams-Cobb receiving corps that led the Packers to the NFC Championship game last season. Don’t forget about Rodgers’ sneaky athletic rushing ability, as he finished in the top five for each of rushing attempts (5th), yards (4th), and touchdowns (T-5th). Rodgers should be the first QB off the board, and don’t hesitate to take him if a load of questionable RB’s or WR’s top the charts while you are on the clock.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Completions/Attempts       | Passing Yards          | Pass TD's | Interceptions  | Rushing Attempts  | Rushing Yards  | Rushing TD's  |
| ------------- | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:|
| **1** | **_Aaron Rodgers_** | 401/610     | 4,428 | 40 | 7 | 67 | 369 | 4 |


**2. Tom Brady - NE:** Brady threw 28 touchdowns and only 2 interceptions in his 12 games after suspension last year en route to another Super Bowl ring. Although he turns 40 this year, he is still in the top level among quarterbacks in New England’s high powered offense. The additions of Brandin Cooks and Dwayne Allen - as well as Rex Burkhead and Mike Gillislee to their already versatile and dangerous running backs - should prove significant to Brady. Don’t forget that Brady led the NFL in vertical yards per attempt last season, so the addition of Cooks could have major upside. Brady is poised for another great season in New England.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Completions/Attempts       | Passing Yards          | Pass TD's | Interceptions  | Rushing Attempts  | Rushing Yards  | Rushing TD's  |
| ------------- | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:|
| **2** | **_Tom Brady_** | 291/432     | 3,554 | 28 | 2 | 28 | 64 | 0 |



**3. Drew Brees - NO:** Brees and coach Sean Payton have developed one of the most consistent passing rapports in recent history. Brees hasn’t thrown less than 4,388 yards since 2005 - his last year in San Diego - and has had five 5,000 yard seasons in that span (out of 11 seasons). Brandin Cooks is off to New England and Adrian Peterson comes to town, as does speedster Ted Ginn, rookie running back Alvin Kamara, and bruising fullback John Kuhn. The backfield quartet of Ingram-Peterson-Kamara-Kuhn provides four different styles of rushing and receiving, and gives Brees more ammunition out of the backfield than he has had since Darren Sproles left New Orleans. Ginn also provides Brees with a deep threat to replace Cooks, at least in a positional sense. One more stat, per Matthew Berry at ESPN - Brees now has 9 straight seasons of 30-plus TD passes. No other team has done that. Expect another monster season for Brees.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Completions/Attempts       | Passing Yards          | Pass TD's | Interceptions  | Rushing Attempts  | Rushing Yards  | Rushing TD's  |
| ------------- | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:|
| **3** | **_Drew Brees_** | 471/673     | 5,208 | 37 | 15 | 23 | 20 | 2 |


**4. Russell Wilson - Sea:** Russell Wilson's passing yardage total has increased every season of his career, per Matthew Berry at ESPN. His rushing took a hit last season due to multiple injuries slowing him down, but he still managed to throw for over 4,000 yards. While [ESPN's consistency ratings](http://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/page/consistency2016/final-2016-fantasy-football-consistency-ratings) show that Wilson is a risk to bust on almost any given week, he is also capable of putting up solid numbers in a consistently dangerous offense. If Wilson can stay healthy this year, he could put up a nice campaign and get (potentially significant) increases in rushing points for your team. Don’t reach for him, but take him if he falls. He's a good low end QB1 this year with upside.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Completions/Attempts       | Passing Yards          | Pass TD's | Interceptions  | Rushing Attempts  | Rushing Yards  | Rushing TD's  |
| ------------- | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:|
| **4** | **_Russell Wilson_** | 353/546     | 4,219 | 21 | 11 | 72 | 259 | 1 |


**5. Andrew Luck - Ind:** Andrew Luck posted a nice campaign last year and is one of the more reliable quarterback options to own in fantasy. His receiving cast, centered around TY Hilton, was depleted slightly by the loss of tight end Dwayne Allen to the Patriots, but hopefully sees a full season from touchdown vulture Donte Moncrief and successful campaigns from Phillip Dorsett and newcomer Kamar Aiken. Jack Doyle’s emergence at tight end also seems to aid Luck’s potential, especially considering Luck’s love for tight ends in the end zone (tight ends have gotten 37% of Luck’s touchdowns over the past three seasons). While injuries have been a problem recently for Luck - he has missed ten games in the last two seasons alone - look for him to have another good year in 2017. He’s a top level quarterback in fantasy.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Completions/Attempts       | Passing Yards          | Pass TD's | Interceptions  | Rushing Attempts  | Rushing Yards  | Rushing TD's  |
| ------------- | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:|
| **5** | **_Andrew Luck_** | 346/545     | 4,240 | 31 | 13 | 64 | 341 | 2 |



**6. Matt Ryan - Atl:** Ryan was ranked as the second most consistent QB in fantasy production by [ESPN's consistency ratings](http://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/page/consistency2016/final-2016-fantasy-football-consistency-ratings) for last season, but could falter due to the departure of offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan. He has had at least 4,500 yards passing every season since 2012, and tightened up his accuracy with a meager 7 interceptions all of last season - to go with his 38 touchdowns. Shanahan may be gone, but the dominant supporting cast around him remains intact, and Ryan is poised for another QB1 fantasy outing this season.  
| Rank  | Player Name  | Completions/Attempts       | Passing Yards          | Pass TD's | Interceptions  | Rushing Attempts  | Rushing Yards  | Rushing TD's  |
| ------------- | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:|
| **6** | **_Matt Ryan_** | 373/534     | 4,944 | 38 | 7 | 35 | 117 | 0 |



 **7** . **Kirk Cousins - Was:** Kirk Cousins threw the ball over 600 times last season, one of only 6 quarterbacks to do so. While two major targets in DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon have left town, as well as former offensive coordinator Sean McVay, Cousins added Terrelle Pryor to his arsenal of weapons that also includes Jamison Crowder and Jordan Reed, as well as sleeper Josh Doctson. Only the powerful New Orleans Saints had more passing yards than the Redskins last season, and Cousins was also one of only 8 quarterbacks to have 4 or more rushing touchdowns in 2016. Cousins may decline a bit from previous production, but is still a solid quarterback to own as a QB1 in Washington.


| Rank  | Player Name  | Completions/Attempts       | Passing Yards          | Pass TD's | Interceptions  | Rushing Attempts  | Rushing Yards  | Rushing TD's  |
| ------------- | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:|
| **7** | **_Kirk Cousins_** | 406/606     | 4,917 | 25 | 12 | 34 | 96 | 4 |



**8.** **Marcus Mariota - Ten:** Marcus Mariota still has never thrown a pick in the red zone. His team gave him an early Christmas this offseason by acquiring Corey Davis, Jonnu Smith, Taywan Taylor, and Eric Decker to add to the offensive corps that garnered him over 3,400 yards last season. Mariota’s legs have not been involved as much as fantasy owners would like in his NFL career thus far, but they are still significant as he had the 6th most rushing yards of all quarterbacks last season with 357. Overall, the additions of the aforementioned players and an expected increase in passing volume due to such should make Mariota a sneaky good QB1.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Completions/Attempts       | Passing Yards          | Pass TD's | Interceptions  | Rushing Attempts  | Rushing Yards  | Rushing TD's  |

**9.**  **Jameis Winston - TB:** While [ESPN's consistency ratings](http://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/page/consistency2016/final-2016-fantasy-football-consistency-ratings) show Winston as a quarterback who could make or break your week, the offseason additions his team has made should prove to benefit him - and perhaps greatly. The Buccaneers added DeSean Jackson, Chris Godwin, and OJ Howard, and should inevitably throw a bit more than Winston’s 567 attempts last season. Matthew Berry pointed out that Winston is the first QB in NFL history to throw for more than 4,000 yards in each of his first two seasons, and he should make that three in a row if his suddenly dangerous supporting cast plays as expected. Winston is an upper level QB2 with QB1 potential.

 **10.** **Cam Newton - Car:** Newton was one of last year’s major disappointments at the quarterback position. However, he suffered from both a concussion and torn rotator cuff last year, and, per Matthew Berry at ESPN, since coming into the league in 2011, Newton has been contacted on 23 percent of his dropbacks, the highest rate in the league. Carolina subtly had the 8th most plays per game of any team at 65.8 in 2016, meaning lots of opportunity for offensive players. Newton got Christian McCaffrey and Curtis Samuel to assist the offense in the wake of Ted Ginn’s departure, and Newton’s legs should be a bit more dangerous this year if his injuries have healed up. He is a sleeper QB2 this season, but make sure you have a reliable backup.

 **11.** **Derek Carr - Oak:** Carr threw only 6 interceptions last season, which is critical for a quarterback in fantasy. In addition, he is throwing to a top level receiving duo in Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree, and also got a large target in Jared Cook in the offseason. While Carr doesn’t blow the doors of in terms of yards per game, he does provide a solid floor to rely on week in and week out as the unquestioned young quarterback of a winning team with weapons. Carr can be even more dominant if he gets his accuracy up (15th in completion percentage in 2016)…or if his teammates improve on their 31 drops from last season. He is a high end QB2 with upside.

**12.**  **Ben Roethlisberger - TB:** Roethlisberger is not exactly a durable quarterback - missing six games in the last two seasons combined and only playing a full season three times out of his sixteen in the NFL - but he does have some of the best weapons in football. Le'Veon Bell and Antonio Brown give Roethlisberger an unmatched RB-WR duo, and the return of Martavis Bryant gives him the deep ball threat that the team missed last year. Roethlisberger’s [home-road split is obvious](http://www.nfl.com/player/benroethlisberger/2506109/situationalstats), but he is still a reliable QB2. Just be sure you have a backup if (when) he goes down for a game or two.

 **13.** **Dak Prescott - Dal:** After a historic rookie season in which he threw only 4 interceptions while leading the Cowboys to a playoff berth, Prescott became the darling of late round fantasy quarterbacks everywhere. He scored six rushing touchdowns (tied for most at the position), and showed to be the sixth most reliable quarterback by [ESPN's consistency ratings](http://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/page/consistency2016/final-2016-fantasy-football-consistency-ratings). Prescott returns most of his supporting cast from last season, and, while a sophomore slump is entirely possible (especially given his mere 4 interceptions), he is still a solid QB2 to own.

| **13** | **_Dak Prescott_** | 311/459    | 3,667 | 23 | 4 | 57 | 282 | 6 |



 **14.**  **Matthew Stafford - Det:** Stafford may not have lit up the scoreboards last season, but he did throw for over 4,300 yards while tossing only 10 interceptions. That said, Stafford lost a reliable end zone target in Anquan Boldin, and had less than 2 passing TD’s in 7 of last 10 games last season. While he is a good bet to throw for over 4,000 yards - and suddenly has not missed a game in six season after being labeled as injury prone early on in his career - Stafford will probably not get the touchdowns necessary in order to jump out of the QB2 range, but he's a reliable QB2 due to (mainly) yardage and opportunity.

**15.** **Philip Rivers - LAC:** Rivers threw a career high 21 interceptions last year, but still managed a solid season of over 4,300 yards and 33 touchdowns. Injuries to his receivers - namely a season ending injury for star receiver Keenan Allen (who should be healthy this year) early on - hampered his upside. The Chargers' first round rookie sensation Mike Williams is banged up a bit to start this season, but the plethora of options available at Rivers' disposal is dangerous for opposing defenses. However, the depth of Rivers’ supporting cast is superb, and the volume at which he is allowed to throw (he has had at least 570 passing attempts in each of the last three seasons) should keep him in the tier three of quarterbacks for fantasy.

 **16.**  **Tyrod Taylor - Buf:** Matthew Berry at ESPN pointed out two key stats that show how sneaky good Tyrod Taylor is as a fantasy quarterback:

1. He is the only player with at least 3,000 passing yards and at least 550 rushing yards in each of past two seasons.

2. Since the beginning of 2015, only Aaron Rodgers and Drew Brees have more games with at least 15-plus (ESPN style) fantasy points than…Tyrod Taylor

What more do you need? Taylor had the most rushing attempts (95), yards (580), and touchdowns (6) last season, while still passing for over 3,000 yards despite only 436 passing attempts and Sammy Watkins hobbling around the field in the few games he was dressed. With Watkins (presumably) healed up and the addition of rookie Zay Jones (as well as run heavy coach Rex Ryan leaving in the offseason), Taylor could bubble towards the top of the QB2 range this season - and he is a very good steal later in drafts.

| **16** | **_Tyrod Taylor_** | 269/436     | 3,023 | 17 | 6 | 95 | 580 | 6 |



 **17.**  **Andy Dalton - Cin:** After a regression in performance during the 2016 season - in which he still threw for over 4,200 yards - Dalton could be in line for a nice rebound this year. Losing Mohamed Sanu and Marvin Jones hurt him last year, but this offseason’s additions of John Ross and Joe Mixon give him new weapons to use alongside AJ Green and Tyler Eifert. Green and Eifert both missed time last season (20 games combined), but look for Andy Dalton to rebound in a big way from his career low 58.1 completion percentage last season. Side note - Dalton is a sneaky effective runner, as he is second among QB’s since he entered the league in 2011 with 18 rushing touchdowns. He's a reliable QB2 that you should be able to snag relatively late.

| **17** | **_Andy Dalton_** | 364/563     | 4,206 | 18 | 8 | 46 | 184 | 4 |



 **18.**  **Eli Manning - NYG:** Despite a whopping 598 passing attempts (7th in the league), Manning managed a mere 4,027 passing yards (13th) and only 21 passing touchdowns (T-10th). The offseason additions of Brandon Marshall and rookie tight end Evan Engram, as well as the emergence of second year wideout Sterling Shepard, give Manning more weapons than he has had in recent memory. However, the Giants were 26th in points scored last season despite their high usage of 3 receiver sets (most in the NFL), and Eli’s high interception totals keep him down in low QB2 range. He also lost 9 yards on 21 rushing attempts in 2016, for what that's worth.

| **18** | **_Eli Manning_** | 377/598     | 4,027 | 26 | 16 | 21 | -9 | 0 |



**19.**  **Carson Palmer - Ari:** Palmer is aging and threw almost 600 passing attempts last season, but he is surrounded by a top level arsenal including David Johnson, Larry Fitzgerald, and John Brown, who should be a full go this season after dealing with health issues last season. The constant threat of Johnson should keep defenses at bay, and the quality players surrounding Palmer should keep the Cardinals passing game dangerous. Palmer is a good late round quarterback pick and should stay put as a solid QB2 this year.

 **20.**  **Carson Wentz - Phi:** Wentz was thrown into the fire his rookie season and was quietly given the fifth most passing attempts in the NFL. His 16 passing touchdowns is low, especially considering the number of attempts, but the Eagles got a lot of weapons this offseason, signing Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith. That’s a good thing because, per Matthew Berry at ESPN, Philadelphia receivers dropped 31 passes, second most in the NFL, with a drop rate of 5.2 percent. The Eagles also signed LeGarrette Blount, and although attempts will go down due to the improved rushing game, there is still high upside here. Wentz could be a trendy pick this year and thus be reached for early, but he is a reliable QB2 (with upside) nonetheless.

**21.**  **Blake Bortles - Jac:** Blake Bortles threw for just under 4,000 yards last season, but also threw the third most passing attempts in the NFL (625). His passing attempts should decrease with the addition of rookie running back Leonard Fournette, who is sure to get a major workload to give the Jaguars the rushing attack they so desperately have been missing during the last few seasons. According to [ESPN's consistency ratings](http://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/page/consistency2016/final-2016-fantasy-football-consistency-ratings), Bortles was just as reliable as James Winston or Ben Roethlisberger in 2016 on a weekly basis. While the addition of Leonard Fournette and major upgrades across the defense could improve Bortles’ efficiency, he is too historically inaccurate (never had a season long completion percentage of 59% or more) to rely on as more than a volume-reliant (and risky) QB2.

| **21** | **_Blake Bortles_** | 368/625     | 3,905 | 23 | 16 | 58 | 359 | 3 |




 **22.**  **Joe Flacco - Bal:** Flacco had the second most passing attempts in the entire NFL last year, one behind Drew Brees at 672. Despite that, his completion percentage was a mere 64.9 (11th), and only 20 of those passes were touchdowns. The Ravens added Jeremy Maclin in free agency along with receiving extraordinaire Danny Woodhead to their backfield, but also lost Dennis Pitta to a devastating hip injury that was followed by his subsequent release. Flacco may throw more than most quarterbacks, but he cannot be relied upon as a fantasy starter. He’s a high-volume reliant backup to take a flier on in later rounds.

 **23.**  **Sam Bradford - Min:** Sam Bradford led the league in completion percentage last year at 71.6%, but was a mere 14th in passing attempts (552), and was 19th in yards per attempt (7.02). The Vikings’ conservative passing attack limits Bradford severely, he does benefit from his efficient passing by throwing 20 touchdowns to only 5 interceptions last season. Bradford shouldn’t, however, be relied on for fantasy purposes, and is a late round backup quarterback.

 **24.**  **Alex Smith - KC:** Smith attempted only 489 passes last year, only 21st in the league, and coupled that with only an average of 7.16 yards per attempt (16th). Andy Reid’s passing attack has been notorious in the fantasy world since he came to Kansas City (and even parts of his tenure in Philadelphia), and Smith - despite leading the Chiefs to relative success - has not been a reliable fantasy option in this time. Consistent as he may be - on par with James Winston and Ben Roethlisberger per [ESPN's consistency ratings](http://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/page/consistency2016/final-2016-fantasy-football-consistency-ratings) - Smith is a low end and low upside QB2.

**25.**  **Jay Cutler - Mia:** Ryan Tannehill suffered another knee injury, forcing the Dolphins to sign Jay Cutler just weeks before the season kicks off. Cutler had planned to retire, but is now reunited with former offensive coordinator Adam Gase. Gase helped Cutler to a decent season in 2016, and could do the same here in Miami with better weapons. Don’t reach for Cutler in drafts, as even with the starting Tannehill the Dolphins’ QB position wasn’t exactly a fantasy gold mine. He’s a bench QB this season coming out of retirement.

**26.**  **Brian Hoyer - SF:** While Hoyer is not an elite quarterback talent, and San Francisco’s offensive weaponry leaves much to be desired, he is in a good position this year to collect a lot of late game fantasy production. Kyle Shanahan has historically been kind to quarterbacks, and Hoyer had relative success playing in Shanahan’s offense in Cleveland in 2014 before getting injured and giving way to the infamous Johnny Manziel. The 49ers figure to be down in games and throwing often during the season, and the addition of Pierre Garcon gives Hoyer a reliable target to throw to. Consider Hoyer a late round, backup flier.

**27.**  **Trevor Siemian - Den:** While not even a shoe-in to start the season opener, Siemian performed admirably during his first season at the helm of the Broncos (especially considering they were defending Super Bowl champions). While only tossing 3,401 yards to go with a meager 18 touchdowns, however, Siemian - if he wins the starting job - is no more than a late round flier as a backup, and lot of that has to do with his supporting cast centered around Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders.

**28.**  **Mike Glennon - Chi:** Garbage Time Glennon could be making a comeback this season, as Chicago enters what is looking to be a rough season. While Jordan Howard is figured to be the centerpiece of the Bears’ offense, Glennon should be throwing a lot late in games as the Bears fall behind. He’s not much more than a volume-reliant backup this season until he proves otherwise.

**29.**  **DeShaun Watson - Hou:** Rookie DeShaun Watson is an interesting prediction to try this season. He is currently behind Tom Savage on the depth chart, but is well positioned to get some playing time this season - if not start Week One. Watson is a threat to make plays with his legs as well as his arm, and has a great corps of receivers in DeAndre Hopkins, Will Fuller V, and CJ Fiedorowicz. Dual-threat quarterbacks have recently had success in their rookie seasons, if nothing else, and if Watson wins the starting job in Houston he is a sleeper QB2 this season. Don't reach for him, however, until that 'if' is figured out.

**30.**  **Jared Goff - LAR:** Goff struggled during his seven game debut last season, but his stock is looking up thanks to a revamping of the coaching staff and the hiring of Sean McVay as head coach - the youngest in NFL history. McVay was the offensive coordinator of the Washington Redskins from 2014-2016, when quarterback play was at the best level that D.C. had seen in over a decade. The addition of Andrew Whitworth should help shore up the offensive line a bit, but Goff is still just a shot in the dark for fantasy purposes until he can find a rhythm. As the first overall pick just last season, however, he's worth that shot in the dark if you need a backup as he will most likely not get benched (pending anything chaotic) due to that draft status.

**31.**  **Matt Moore - Mia.:** With Tannehill suffering an injury in training camp, Matt Moore becomes a suddenly eligible fantasy quarterback. That said, the Dolphins’ passing offense has historically made Tannehill nothing more than a low end QB2, so don’t rely on Moore’s scores to carry you to many wins.

**32.**  **Tom Savage - Hou:** Savage is, as of this writing, penciled in as the starter in Houston. First round pick DeShaun Watson should push him, however, and Savage may give way to the rookie at some point in the season - if not before week one. Don’t take Savage unless you have to.

**34.**  **Brock Osweiler - Cle:** Osweiler was traded to Cleveland in a bizarre, basketball-style trade this offseason that saw the Browns take on his massive salary while obtaining a future second round pick to do so. Osweiler joins a crowded QB room with Cody Kessler, DeShone Kizer, and Kevin Hogan, and it is unclear who will win the starting job for the season. Osweiler does look like the odd man out, but keep close watch on the Browns’ quarterback job in the next few weeks, as Osweiler could be closer to starting than we all think.

A mostly career backup with a reasonable arm and decent game managing ability, McCown seems to be the alleged week one starter for the chaotic New York Jets. He is being pushed by Christina Hackenberg and Bryce Petty, whom are expected to get some work this season. Don’t take McCown with too much optimism.

 **36.**  **Paxton Lynch - Den:** Paxton Lynch sat behind Trevor Siemian last season, but is pushing him for the starting job here in 2017. Lynch has weapons around him in Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders, is a tree in the pocket at 6’7”, and is also a sneaky good rusher as he had at least 87 rushing attempts in each of his three starting seasons at Memphis. If Lynch wins the starting job away from Siemian in training camp, he is a nice sleeper pick late in drafts.

**37.**  **DeShone Kizer - Cle:** The rookie out of Notre Dame possesses traits that bode well in the AFC North in a big arm and subtle mobility, but is currently behind Cody Kessler on the depth chart. Surely, Kizer will start a few games this year as Kessler was oft-injured last season, but don’t rely on Kizer for your fantasy team until he’s at least named the starting quarterback.

 **38.**  **Cody Kessler - Cle:** Cody Kessler was surprisingly efficient in his rookie season despite it being an alleged red shirt year before injuries happened. He posted a 92.3 passer rating and had a 65.6% passing completion percentage. Kessler suffered, however, from a poor offensive line and was injured multiple times throughout the season. If he can hold onto the starting job, expect Alex Smith and Sam Bradford level numbers from Kessler until the Browns’ offense finds their rhythm.

**39.**  **Teddy Bridgewater - Min:** Coming off a major knee injury, Bridgewater is behind Sam Bradford in Minnesota and not worth drafting in redraft formats unless any news comes out of Minnesota prior to Week 1. While he flashed some talent in his time starting, he is still recovering from a devastating injury.

 **40.**  **Mitch Trubisky - Chi:** Nobody knows what exactly Chicago was thinking when trading up one pick to select Trubisky at two overall, but they did name Mike Glennon the starter for this season after signing him to a fairly large contract. That makes Trubisky virtually worthless in fantasy leagues, as he probably won’t see the field much this season while he learns the offense behind Glennon.

**41. Christian Hackenberg - NYJ:** The former Penn State quarterback could push Josh McCown for starts in New York at any given time. That doesn't mean, however, he’s fantasy relevant. Keep him off your radar in redraft leagues until you see that he is pushing to start.

## **_RB:_**

**1.** **David Johnson - Ari:** A surefire fantasy stalwart, Bruce Arians has already stated he wants Johnson to get roughly 30 touches per game this season (he averaged 23.3 in 2016). If that happens, Johnson could shoot to astronomical fantasy numbers. The more realistic occurrence, however, is that his touches regress closer to the mean and remain in the low 20’s - which is still a dominant fantasy season for the running back. He is tied for the most reliable running back in fantasy per [ESPN's consistency ratings](http://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/page/consistency2016/final-2016-fantasy-football-consistency-ratings), and should be among the first few picks in all leagues this year.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Rushing Attempts       | Rushing Yards          | Yards Per Carry | Rushing TD’s  | Receptions  | Receiving Yards  | Receiving TD's  |

| **1** | **_David Johnson_** | 293     | 1,239 | 4.2 | 16 | 80 | 879 | 4 |



**2.** **Le’Veon Bell - Pit:** Despite Bell’s contract dispute during this offseason, he is still one of the most dominant running backs in the game - and thus a major fantasy asset. He was second in the NFL with 75 receptions last season and 94 targets, both to David Johnson, and looks to be a major factor in a potent Steelers’ offense again this season. Bell is a surefire top pick again this season in a very central role in the Pittsburgh offense, but keep monitoring his contract situation until it is fully resolved.

| **2** | **_Le’Veon Bell_** | 261     | 1,268 | 4.9 | 7 | 75 | 616 | 2 |



**3.** **Ezekiel Elliott - Dal:** Ezekiel Elliott had himself quite a rookie year, exploding for over 1,600 yards and punching in 15 rushing touchdowns along the way. Zeke also led the league in rushing attempts (322) and rushes of over 20+ yards with 14 (the next closest was LeSean McCoy with 11), so if your league counts big play scoring bonuses, keep that in mind. While the Cowboys’ line has taken a bit of a hit this offseason, they should still be among the best in the game, propelling Zeke to another big season. Zeke is a top five pick, however, keep a look out for pending disciplinary action following his offseason antics - you may need to grab his handcuff later.

| **3** | **_Ezekiel Elliott_** | 322     | 1,631 | 5.1 | 15 | 32 | 363 | 1 |



**4.** **LeSean McCoy - Buf:** Shady has been a valuable fantasy asset since back when he was on the Eagles for the first part of his career. He was tenth among running backs with 50 receptions last season, and was also third in yards per rushing attempt with 5.4. While the departure of Rex Ryan - who loves to run- should decrease McCoy’s workload a bit, the departure of Mike Gillislee to New England removes last year’s carry vulture from his shadow. McCoy’s carry share has progressively decreased from 75 percent in 2011 to right around 70 percent during the 2012-14 seasons to 62 percent in 2015 (his first with Buffalo) and to 58 percent in 2016, per Mike Clay at ESPN. Watch out for more slight regression, but Shady is still a top running back pick headed into his age 29 season.

| **4** | **_LeSean McCoy_** | 234    | 1,267 | 5.4 | 13 | 50 | 356 | 1 |



**5.** **Melvin Gordon - LAC:** Gordon came out of nowhere last season and took full advantage of the injury to Danny Woodhead while taking over the Chargers’ backfield. His 254 rushing attempts were 10th in the league last year, and although he averaged only a meager 3.9 yards per carry (lower than Christine Michael, Alfred Blue, and Terrance West, among others), Gordon still receives the necessary volume to be an adequate fantasy starter. Look for Gordon to regress a bit in the wake of the Chargers’ improved passing attack, but to still be a top level running back as he again should be among the league leaders in rushing attempts.

| **5** | **_Melvin Gordon_** | 254     | 997 | 3.9 | 10 | 41 | 419 | 2 |



**6.** **Devonta Freeman - Atl:** While Devonta Freeman is frequently vultured by Tevin Coleman in both the rushing and receiving departments, he is still a top fantasy back to own. The departure of offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan could hurt his production (along with the rest of the Atlanta offense), but not enough to drop him out of top running back position for fantasy purposes. He was one of only four RB’s last year (along with David Johnson, Le’Veon Bell, and DeMarco Murray) to have at least 200 rushing attempts and 60 receiving targets, and also scored 11 touchdowns on the ground while averaging 4.8 yards per carry. Per Tristan Cockroft as ESPN, he has scored the second-most non-PPR (456.9) and PPR (576.9) fantasy points since taking over as the Falcons' starting running back in Week 3 of 2015. Freeman remains an RB1 in fantasy purposes - but grabbing Coleman later as a handcuff might not be a bad look.

| **6** | **_Devonta Freeman_** | 227     | 1,079 | 4.8 | 11 | 54 | 462 | 2 |



**7.** **Jay Ajayi - Mia:** Ajayi was not the starter during Week One of last season, but he showed why that was a mistake after breakouts in Weeks 5 and 6 where he ran for over 200 yards in both contests. Miami is so run heavy that Ajayi was 9th in rushing attempts (260) despite not locking down the starting role until Week 5, and that figures to continue this year despite the extension of Kenny Stills and the coaches’ uptalk of Devante Parker. Ajayi is a lower level RB1 this year, with some upside and propensity for huge games.

| **7** | **_Jay Ajayi_** | 260     | 1,272 | 4.9 | 8 | 27 | 151 | 0 |



**8.** **Jordan Howard - Chi:** Jordan Howard averaged a whopping 5.2 yards per carry last season and put up 1,313 despite not beginning the year as the starting running back. A heavy workload (11th most carries) and meager passing attack should keep Howard in nice fantasy territory on a Bears team that lacks many significant fantasy options. Howard also ranked 7th in starting percentage via [ESPN's consistency ratings](http://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/page/consistency2016/final-2016-fantasy-football-consistency-ratings), ahead of the likes of Le’Veon Bell and Lamar Miller. Don’t reach for Howard, as defenses will be locked in on him this year which could bring him down to earth, but he is well worth a pick as a low level RB1.

| **8** | **_Jordan Howard_** | 252     | 1,313 | 5.2 | 6 | 29 | 298 | 1 |



**9.** **DeMarco Murray - Ten:** Murray was a surprise stud at running back last season - his first in a Titans uniform. He was immediately thrust into a workhorse role, as he was 3rd in the NFL with 293 carries, but was efficient enough to churn out over 1,200 yards at 4.4 yards per carry, tied for 13th among eligible running backs. Murray was sneaky effective in the receiving game, as well, being one of only 11 running backs to have at least 50 receptions. While Derrick Henry should steal more work this season - particularly near the goal line - Murray is still set up for a another big year in Tennessee. He was rated as the fourth most reliable back per [ESPN's consistency ratings](http://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/page/consistency2016/final-2016-fantasy-football-consistency-ratings), and his high volume (3rd in carries and 6th among RB’s in receptions) should keep him as a solid RB1.

| **9** | **_DeMarco Murray_** | 293     | 1,287 | 4.4 | 9 | 53 | 377 | 3 |



**10.** **Todd Gurley - LAR:** Todd Gurley was one of fantasy’s biggest disappointments last season, but the team around him was as big a factor as anything else. The Rams added a new coach in Sean McVay and also signed veteran tackle Andrew Whitworth to cover the left side, giving Gurley and the Rams an entirely new look offense from last season. That is not to say Gurley’s meager 3.2 yards per carry or 6 rushing touchdowns on the season should skyrocket to astronomical heights, but he did have the fifth most carries in the NFL last season. Opportunity is a significant catalyst to fantasy success, and Gurley has a lot of it. Gurley could fall in many drafts, but he is surely a top bounce back candidate for this fantasy season, so don’t leave him for too long.

**11.** **Leonard Fournette - Jac:** One of the most hyped rookies in this loaded class, Leonard Fournette brings a dynamic rushing element that the Jaguars haven’t seen since Maurice Jones-Drew. He had an ankle injury last season at LSU, but he looks to be an immediate factor in the Jaguars game plans this season. Touchdowns could be scarce, as that depends on the Jaguars’ offense as a whole, but Fournette should be an RB2 via workload alone. He is a sleeper pick due to his ability, and could be a steal if he falls far down the RB boards.

**12.** **Lamar Miller - Hou:** Miller barely broke the 1,000 yard plateau last season despite the 6th most carries in the league (268), averaging 4.0 yards per carry. He also suffered due to the Texans’ meager offense, scoring just 6 touchdowns total and only 5 on the ground. The selection of D’Onta Foreman doesn’t bode well for Miller’s 2016 workload to repeat itself, but Miller will still be the workhorse in what should be a (slightly) more threatening offense this season. He’s a nice RB2, but keep tabs on the Houston QB situation. Watson could open up a lot for Miller with his dual-threat potential, if he starts.

| **12** | **_Lamar Miller_** | 268     | 1,073 | 4.0 | 5 | 31 | 188 | 1 |



**13.** **Isaiah Crowell - Cle:** Isaiah Crowell is an interesting pick this season, as the Browns restocked and now have one of the (alleged) best lines in football. Crowell - who has never missed a game in his three year NFL career - averaged 4.8 yards per carry last season behind one of the worst lines in the league, and head coach Hue Jackson has expressed multiple times that he wants to run the ball more this season. Per Matthew Berry at ESPN, Crowell is one of only six backs in the NFL under the age of 30 with at least 145 carries in each of the past three seasons, and only LeSean McCoy, Ezekiel Elliott, Jay Ajayi, and Mike Gillislee were the RB’s last year that had more yards per carry and more rushing TD’s than Crowell. Crowell is a solid RB2 with upside this year, and could be in for more if Duke Johnson moves to the slot receiver role.

| **13** | **_Isaiah Crowell_** | 198     | 952 | 4.8 | 7 | 40 | 319 | 0 |



**14.** **Carlos Hyde - SF:** Hyde has been an injury prone back since reentered the league back in 2014. Hyde only had 33 targets last season, but turned 3 of them into touchdowns. Don’t expect that to repeat, but he could benefit from Kyle Shanahan’s offense and its past usage of running backs. Hyde averaged 4.6 yards per carry when he was healthy last year as well as 76 yards per game, but staying healthy is the tough part as he's missed 14 of 48 possible games in his career. The 49ers addressed their backfield a decent amount this offseason, putting Hyde’s role in potential jeopardy, but he’s a high upside RB2 if he keeps the starting role and can maintain good health throughout the season.

| **14** | **_Carlos Hyde_** | 217     | 988 | 4.6 | 6 | 27 | 163 | 3 |



**15.** **Marshawn Lynch - Oak::** The biggest enigma in this season’s draft, Lynch took a year off after playing only 7 games in the 2015 season due to multiple injuries. While the Raiders have a good offensive line, Lynch is 31 years old, and a 31 year old running back has only had a 1,000 yard season five times in last decade - Thomas Jones, Fred Taylor, Ricky Williams, and Frank Gore (twice) - and only three times has one had a double digit touchdown season (Thomas Jones, DeAngelo Williams, Ricky Williams). Per Mike Clay at ESPN, during Jack Del Rio's past seven seasons as a head coach, no fewer than 19 percent and no more than 22 percent of his offense's targets have gone to the running back position. While young backs DeAndre Washington and Jalen Richard could take a lot of this work, Lynch should still get his share. Lynch should be a touchdown vulture this season, as he has been for most of his career, but it is yet to be seen how powerful of a runner he can be after a full season off and 2,144 career carries. He should be a solid RB2, but don’t reach for him too high.

**16.** **Ty Montgomery - GB:** The Packers selected three running backs in this year’s NFL Draft, but Montgomery’s 5.9 yards per carry average is hard to ignore. As a converted receiver, he is also a significant threat in the passing game, as well. However, even without the three rookies in the picture last season, Montgomery had over 10 carries just once - a week 15 game against Chicago when he exploded for his biggest game of the season. Keep an eye on the Green Bay backfield in upcoming weeks, but Montgomery offers some flex appeal even as part of a committee - for the first part of the season, at least.

**17.** **Joe Mixon - Cin:** Cincinnati is one of 2 teams with 440 plus rushing attempts in each of the last four years, and controversial rookie Joe Mixon steps into a great situation with neither Jeremy Hill or Giovani Bernard playing exceptionally well last year. Say what you want about Mixon’s character, but he is a unique on-field prospect who is adept at both rushing and receiving. The loss of lineman Andrew Whitworth and Kevin Zeitler does not bode well for Mixon’s prospects, but the addition of John Ross should open up defenses enough for there to be a few holes for Mixon to explode through this season. Don’t reach for the rookie, but he could be a prime sleeper candidate this year.

**18.** **Christian McCaffrey - Car:** Another rookie is what could be a promising landing situation, McCaffrey gives the Panthers a unique weapon that is difficult to find anywhere in the NFL. McCaffrey is top level at rushing, receiving, and returning, and is an athlete through and through. While Jonathan Stewart is still there to vulture carries in Carolina, expect McCaffrey to put up decent rushing numbers and monster receiving numbers. In PPR leagues, McCaffrey could be a steal at RB2 - keep in mind how many points Danny Woodhead has scored in past years.

**19.** **CJ Anderson - Den:** Workload could be a problem for CJ Anderson this season, as Devontae Booker and recently signed Jamaal Charles should compete with him for touches. The mediocre passing game in Denver does not help Anderson’s cause either, but he shouldn’t be going too high in many fantasy leagues. Anderson’s 4.0 yard per carry average last season is concerning - as is his coming off of a season ending knee injury - but he is a decent pick later in your draft as a flex player.

**20.** **Mark Ingram - NO:** Adrian Peterson coming to New Orleans was a top headline this offseason, but Ingram is still the leading running back for the Saints despite seeing some time in coach Sean Payton’s doghouse at the end of last season. He averaged a sneaky 5.1 yards per carry, and added in over 300 receiving yards (but don’t rely on his 4 receiving TD’s to repeat). Per Mike Clay at ESPN, at least 22 percent of the Saints' targets have been directed at the running back position during each of their past 10 seasons. The average during that span is 26 percent, and it reached as high as 32 percent in 2013. While Peterson may steal some rushing attempts and goal line work (per Matthew Berry at ESPN, the Saints have had at least 16 rushing touchdowns in three straight seasons), but Ingram should benefit the most from the passing game. As a solid runner and the best receiving back in New Orleans’ backfield, Ingram is a solid RB2.

**21.** **Spencer Ware - KC:** Spencer Ware must fend of highly touted rookie Kareem Hunt for snaps, rushes, and receiving targets this season in order to stay fantasy relevant throughout. If your league counts big play bonuses, Ware is a fine target as he was tied for second with 8 receptions of 20+ yards behind only David Johnson. The Andy Reid offense has historically been running back friendly, and that should not change anytime soon. Ware is not someone to reach for early on, but is a solid RB2 selection.

**22.** **Mike Gillislee - NE:** Up in New England, LeGarrette Blount had almost 300 carries last year as a nearly unprecedented workhorse RB in the Belichick era. Blount is now in Philadelphia, however, and Mike Gillislee was brought in - along with Rex Burkhead - to compete with James White and Dion Lewis for touches. That’s quite the crowded conundrum behind Brady, and Belichick (usually) likes to mix it up with his backs. Despite that, Gillislee made a great season of limited work in 2016, and he could be a steal if he falls deep in your draft. Gillislee averaged 5.7 yards per carry last season in Buffalo, and has 12 TDs in his 23 career games. New England led league in 2016 with carries inside the five and inside the ten - areas where Gillislee excelled and stole work from LeSean McCoy - and could provide Gillislee with a big boost from touchdowns. He’s an intriguing sleeper pick this season.

**23.** **Dalvin Cook - Min:** Dalvin Cook was a highly ranked rookie coming out of college this past year, but landed in a tough spot to be a running back. While Cook is capable of handling large loads of both carries and receiving targets, he is currently behind recently signed Latavius Murray on the depth chart. The Vikings’ offensive line isn’t exactly world class, either, but [Pro Football Focus](https://www.profootballfocus.com/news/pro-ranking-all-32-offensive-line-units-heading-into-the-2017-season) did notate the alleged improvement this offseason upon their woes last season. Cook should get a lot of touches his rookie season, and should supplant himself as the lead back in Minnesota before we know it. It’s just a matter of producing. Cook is a fine sleeper play to slide into your flex position once he gets the consistent reps to be fantasy relevant.

**24.** **Eddie Lacy - Sea:** Lacy actually played well when healthy last season, despite his reputation. He averaged over 5 yards per carry in 2016, and could be a touchdown vulture in Seattle’s solid offense. While he will surely compete with CJ Prosise for work, Lacy is a nice bounce back candidate late in the draft as a flex player. His range for points, however, could go from solid RB2 to waiver wire material, as we have seen in years past, so take precaution with timing when selecting Lacy this season.

**25.** **Bilal Powell - NYJ:** Bilal Powell is a popular name among fantasy circles this offseason as a sleeper pick, and perhaps rightfully so. Powell averaged 5.5 yards per carry last year and had 58 receptions - 4th most in the NFL. Powell dominated at the end of 2016 when given a full time role, and had 411 rushing yards to go along with 141 receiving yards in a four game span to close out the season. With Powell looking to lead the charge in what should be a miserable Jets offense, touchdowns will most likely be scarce. However, Powell’s versatility and production last season make him an interesting flex play this year, or an RB2 in PPR leagues.

**26.** **Ameer Abdullah - Det:** Abdullah averaged 4.2 yards per carry in his rookie season, but was hurt last year after 158 yards on 23 touches. He averaged 5.6 yards per army in his limited time last season, and also added over 10 yards per reception (he had 5). Keep in mind Abdullah was a second round pick, so Detroit most likely will not toss him to the wayside this early despite his injury history. Theo Riddick may still be present, but Abdullah is the sleeper back to watch in Detroit. The efficient passing offense led by Matt Stafford will allow Abdullah to produce if given adequate opportunities, but as long as Riddick is healthy, those opportunities will be limited. Abdullah is a nice sleeper pick for your flex spot.

**27.** **Frank Gore - Ind:** Gore cannot defy Father Time forever, but it doesn’t really appear that this season will be his demise. Tristan Cockroft at ESPN noted that (1) Gore is the only running back in football to have started all 32 games over the past two seasons, and (2) has also managed at least 15 carries in 20 of his 32 games since joining the Colts after the 2014 season. While Gore is thought of as a downhill runner, he also contributed 38 receptions last year (and 4 receiving touchdowns!), and his lowest PPR finish since 2005 was 21st in 2014. His carries will most likely dip a bit due to the selection of rookie Marlon Mack, but the running back position in Indianapolis is Gore’s until he or his body decides otherwise.

**28.** **Tevin Coleman - Atl:** Coleman is arguably the NFL’s best handcuff for fantasy purposes, and that is mostly due to the fact that he is a fantasy starter even with Freeman in the lineup. Averaging 4.4 yards per carry and accumulating the 8th most receiving yards of all running backs, Coleman also scored 11 touchdowns in a non-starting role last season. The departure of Kyle Shanahan could hurt production for both running backs, but both have shown enough in their respective careers to each warrant significant touches. If you have Freeman, coupling him with Coleman will be frustrating, but could prove fruitful in the long run. Coleman on his own is worth flex appeal, at the very least.

**29.** **Paul Perkins - NYG:** Perkins averaged 4.8 yards per carry in his final three games of last regular season, and was handed the starting job this offseason by the Giants’ coaching staff. While the Giants called a running play on only 38.39% of plays last season (23rd in the league), Perkins at least offers the value of being the main back in New York, and the workload he is presumed to have alone warrants his value as a flex player.

**30.** **LeGarrette Blount - Phi:** Outside of last year, Blount has had only one other 1,000 yard season and only one other season with more than 6 rushing TD’s. He had 18 rushing TD’s last year and is most likely due for the dreaded fantasy touchdown regression this season. While an up and coming passing attack bolstered by free agent wideouts Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith could help Blount’s odds in the running game, he will also (most likely) not repeat his 299 carry season from last year. Don’t reach for Blount based on last year’s production, but he could be a solid flex or borderline RB2 - especially if the Eagles’ line is [as good as it is made out to be](https://www.profootballfocus.com/news/pro-ranking-all-32-offensive-line-units-heading-into-the-2017-season)

**31.** **Danny Woodhead - Bal:** Woodhead was acquired by the Ravens this offseason, and could sneak into a good season on a Baltimore team that has thrown more than any other team in the last two seasons. Woodhead was 3rd in PPR leagues in 2015 (his last full season), and Marty Mornhinweg (in his first year as Baltimore’s offensive coordinator) threw 26.9% of completions to the backfield. With Kenneth Dixon being sidelined for the rest of the season, look for Woodhead to be a major factor out of the backfield, and thus a popular sleeper pick this season. Don’t let him fall to far, but recognize that Terrance West is also in the mix and will steal plenty of carries, so don’t reach either. Woodhead could sneak into RB2 territory in PPR leagues.

**32.** **Adrian Peterson - NO:** Peterson was signed away from the Vikings to join Mark Ingram and rookie Alvin Kamara in the New Orleans backfield. Per Matthew Berry at ESPN, the Saints have had at least 16 rushing touchdowns in three straight seasons. Peterson should figure to get a lot of the goal line carries, as Ingram and Kamara are more suited to handle the passing duties, but don’t rely on Peterson to be the workhorse here. Splitting carries with Mark Ingram is bad enough, but rookie Kamara was highly touted in this year’s draft and could pose a more serious threat than many realize. Don’t value Peterson as anything more than a flex option on draft day.

**33.** **Doug Martin - TB:** Doug Martin has a 3 game suspension to start the season, and he has been hot and cold throughout his career. In the last five seasons, Martin has three seasons in which he rushed for less than 500 yards, and two in which he’s rushed for over 1,400 yards. Those two seasons represent two of the only 11 instances of a player rushing for 1,400 yards in a season since 2010. While the additions of DeSean Jackson and rookie tight end OJ Howard should open up defenses more often, it remains to be seen how Martin will be when coming back from his 3 week vacation. Don’t value him as anything more than a flex position.

**34.** **Terrance West - Bal:** West did well last season in Baltimore, factoring in both the rushing and receiving game in the league’s most pass heavy offense. West’s role should increase with the season ending injury to Kennth Dixon, and he could cement himself as the early down back in Baltimore with a few good showings to begin the season. He averaged only 4 yards per carry last season, but should pose to be a good late round running back pick as he could be the pseudo-workhorse back for the Ravens this year. He could end up as a nice flex play.

**35.** **Jonathan Stewart - Car:** The high selection of Christian McCaffrey drops Stewart’s fantasy value significantly. Already touchdown reliant last season (9 touchdowns despite averaging 3.8 yards per carry), Stewart may now be relegated to purely short yardage or touchdown situations - ironically taking over the sort of role Mike Tolbert vultured from him for so many years. Stewart is, at this point, a handcuff or late round flier for fantasy purposes.

**36.** **Derrick Henry - Ten:** While Henry performed well as a rookie - averaging 4.5 yards per carry and adding a respectable 13 catches for 137 yards receiving in limited action - he is still behind DeMarco Murray on the depth chart in Tennessee. Murray is 29 this season, but showed no signs of slowing down last year. While Henry is a talent in his own right, he is still a premium handcuff to own in fantasy. Otherwise, he barely fringes on flex worthy.

**37.** **Robert Kelley - Was:** Robert Kelley led all rookies last year with a missed tackle every 4.8 carries, and was sufficient when he took over Washington’s running back duties in the middle of 2016. However, rookie Samaje Perine is appearing to threaten his position for early down and short yardage situation. Washington’s backfield is one to monitor throughout the preseason, as this could be anyone’s job. Kelley averaged only 4.2 yards per carry last season - not exactly out of this world - and is thus a risky pick to be reliant on in fantasy. He’s a dice roll flex player until the Redskins’ backfield hierarchy pans out.

**38.** **Samaje Perine - Was:** Rookie Samaje Perine was drafted out of Oklahoma this past April, and joins Robert Kelley and Chris Thompson in what poses to be a crowded Washington backfield. Perine is a bruising runner, and figures to get a lot of goal line work and short yardage situations. That said, keep tabs on the Redskins’ backfield to see if Perine or Kelley will be getting the majority of snaps in the first few weeks of the season.

**39.** **Theo Riddick - Det:** Riddick missed six games last season, but was still tied for 6th among running backs in receptions with 53. His rushing average of 3.9 yards per carry leaves much to be desired, but his prowess in the receiving game makes him a solid flex play in PPR formats, but Ameer Abdullah may take a large chunk of the carries this season…if he can also stay healthy. Don’t reach for Riddick, but he’s worth a mid-to-late round selection in PPR leagues.

**40.** **Matt Forte - NYJ:** With Bilal Powell dominating after Forte’s knee injury late last season, it seems that Forte has long his stronghold on the Jets’ leading backfield position. The Jets’ abysmal passing offense isn’t going to help Forte’s case, and opposing defenses are aware of that. Don’t rely on Forte to be much more than a handcuff to Powell - which in itself is not that enticing - in a poor Jets offense.

**41.** **Kareem Hunt - KC:** Over the last 10 seasons, Andy Reid’s running backs have averaged 4.4 yards per carry and 15.8 TD’s per season. Rookie Kareem Hunt slides into a perfect offensive fit for his skill set, as he is a well versed back similar to old Eagles tailback Brian Westbrook - who had great success with Reid in Philly. Hunt is a major handcuff to own for Spencer Ware, and could be a flex play in his own right once the season gets going. He is surely worth a flier later in drafts.

**42.** **CJ Prosise - Sea:** The backfield in Seattle got a lot more crowded with the addition of Eddie Lacy this offseason, and Prosise could find his work mostly reliant on receiving as opposed to rushing despite his 5.7 yards per carry average last year. With Lacy and Thomas Rawls both on the roster as well, Prosise is a flex play with upside (especially in PPR leagues) until the Seattle backfield situation is sorted out. He could rise higher than that - especially due to the inconsistency of Lacy - but don’t reach too high in drafts for him unless more developments occur in his favor.

**43.** **Duke Johnson - Cle:** The electric back out of Miami has always been a receiving threat, with 114 receptions in a mere 32 games in his young career, but last season his rushing yards per carry average jumped up to 4.9. Coach Hue Jackson has stated he wants to run the ball more this season, and there has also been mention of Johnson potentially taking over slot receiver role in Cleveland after [Andrew Hawkins’ retirement](http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2017/07/cleveland_browns_training_camp_155.html). Take Johnson as a sleeper late in drafts, as the slot receiver potential propels him to opportunities not often found this far down in draft boards for running backs, but don't expect him to ignite your team with double digit points every week despite the potential new role.

**44.** **Latavius Murray - Min:** Murray was signed by the Vikings as a free agent this offseason only to see the team draft polarizing rookie Dalvin Cook in the NFL Draft this past April. He averaged 4.0 yards per carry last season but joins a Vikings offense that ranked 23rd in total points and 28th in total yards in 2016. Combine that with the rookie Cook breathing over his shoulder, Murray is a risky pick until later in drafts as he may not be the starter too far into the season.

**45.** **James White - NE:** White was joined by Mike Gillislee and Rex Burkhead in the New England backfield this season, and the roles behind Tom Brady are all difficult to pinpoint at this stage. White was a force out of the backfield last season, with the third most receptions among RB’s with 60, and averaged a respectable 4.3 yards per carry. White is obviously worth a lot more in PPR formats, but is still only a flex at best until we see a consistent workload increase for him.

**46.** **Jeremy Hill - Cin:** Hill has always been a touchdown and short yardage vulture, but the selection of Joe Mixon by Cincinnati in this year’s draft only diminishes Hill’s role further. Mixon has the tools to be a three down back in the NFL, and Hill’s 3.8 yards per carry average despite 222 rushing attempts last season isn’t much of an obstacle to overcome. Hill is, realistically, little more than a handcuff for Mixon.

**47.** **Thomas Rawls - Sea:** - How much do you trust Eddie Lacy? That’s what Rawls’ value comes down to this season. Despite his meager 3.2 yards per carry last year, Rawls has been a productive runner in Seattle in the past and could thrive again if Lacy is removed from the lineup for whatever reason. CJ Prosise will most likely take the passing role, but Rawls could definitely take the job from Lacy at some point during the season. He’s worth a shot in later rounds as a sleeper pick at running back.

**48.** **Jacquizz Rodgers -TB:** Rodgers has a good shot at snagging a nice role in Tampa Bay while Doug Martin serves his 3 game suspension to start the season. He had over 100 yards rushing in both games he was given 20 or more carries last season, and could prove himself to be worth playing even in the wake of Martin’s return. Rodgers is worth a late round flier in fantasy drafts.

**50.** **Giovani Bernard - Cin:** Bernard is a quality receiving back - as evidenced by his 39 receptions in ten games before his injury last season - but struggles as a runner, as evidenced by his 3.7 yards per carry average. Bernard will undoubtedly suffer from the addition of rookie Joe Mixon, but could also keep passing down duties early on. Don’t forget about him deep into drafting during PPR leagues.

**51.** **Jamaal Charles - Den:** The injury prone Charles is coming off of yet another injury and now joins a new team in Denver, where he is joined in the backfield by CJ Anderson and Devontae Booker. While he was notorious for his electric playmaking ability while in Kansas City, don’t expect much from Charles in his new role in Denver. It remains to be seen what the Broncos’ pecking order will be like, but Charles is not only a risky pick due to injury concerns, but opportunity concerns as well.

**52.** **Darren Sproles - Phi:** Sproles averaged 4.7 yards per carry last season while still providing over 420 receiving yards on 52 receptions. While LeGarrette Blount should take the majority of the rushing downs this season, Sproles should still factor into the receiving game. He’s not worth much consideration for fantasy purposes unless it’s PPR scoring, even in which he’s worth bench or fringe flex consideration.

**53.** **Joe Williams - SF:** Rookie Joe Williams is an intriguing pick in fantasy this season, but shouldn’t be reached for until the Niners’ backfield gets sorted out a bit more. He has potential to steal some touches from Carlos Hyde, and Williams is worth a look in his own right as Hyde is often injured. As a valuable handcuff commodity and intriguing runner on his own, Williams is a decent running back flier in fantasy drafts this year.

**54.** **DeAndre Washington - Oak:** Washington is a very elusive back and is one of two parts of the young running back duo breathing down Marshawn Lynch’s neck this season. He was electric when given the ball last season, averaging 5.4 yards per carry and adding 17 receptions to boot. With the aging Lynch coming off of a retirement season, keep an eye on Washington to take snaps on both rushing and passing downs. Mike Clay at ESPN noted that during Jack Del Rio's past seven seasons as a head coach no fewer than 19 percent and no more than 22 percent of his offense's targets have gone to the running back position. Washington is a nice late round flier in PPR leagues, especially as a handcuff to Lynch.

**55.** **Rex Burkhead - NE:** Burkhead could be a solid sleeper pick this late, as he showed some flashes when given opportunity last season. He had a great game against Baltimore when he got significant work at the end of last season, when he got 27 rushes for 119 yards and 2 TD’s, and added an extra 2 catches for 25 yards through the air. Belichick has a way of mixing up his running backs, making Burkhead a risky pick, but his 4.6 yards per carry average and exceptional receiving ability gives him some intriguing upside among late round backs.

**56.** **Alvin Kamara - NO:** 2017 Draft pick Alvin Kamara joins a fantasy-bountiful backfield in New Orleans that is unfortunately (for him) already populated by Mark Ingram and recently signed Adrian Peterson. The Saints have a juggernaut offense, however, and Kamara could still work out a role on passing downs despite Ingram’s receiving ability. He’s worth a look deep into drafts - especially in PPR leagues - as both Ingram and Peterson have missed time to injuries in recent years.

**57.** **Chris Thompson - Was:** Thompson had the 11th most targets of any running back last season with 62 as a part time player. Despite playing behind Rob Kelley and Matt Jones, he also accumulated 5.2 yards per carry during the campaign in which he did not miss a game. He does not score many touchdowns, and is therefore not reliable for fantasy purposes, but could be a sneaky late round pick in PPR leagues, especially if someone in Washington’s crowded backfield gets injured.

**58.** **Dion Lewis - NE:** New England ran the 7th most plays per game last season (66), and Lewis is a passing down specialist that has proven he can thrive in the Tom Brady-Bill Belichick system. Lewis has new competition this season in the form of Rex Burkhead and Mike Gillislee (to go along with the returning James White), but could still prove effective in the passing game. Lewis is worth a late look in PPR leagues, but is a risky pick due to the variability in Belichick’s running back usage throughout time.

**59.** **Marlon Mack - Ind:** Rookie Marlon Mack is backing up the ageless Frank Gore this season, and is a valuable handcuff to own. Gore is 34 years old and bound to regress eventually, so Mack is valuable as a handcuff and worth a (super) late flier in fantasy drafts, especially if you are short on running backs.

**60.** **Darren McFadden - Dal:** As the backup to Ezekiel Elliott behind a solid Cowboys line, McFadden is an incredible handcuff commodity as well as worth owning in his own right - especially is Elliott gets suspended for his antics. He had 1,000 yards just two years ago in 2015 behind this same Cowboys line, and is a great late round pick in drafts this season. He could be a great fantasy back if Elliott gets suspended or injured.

**61.** **Charles Sims - TB:** Charles Sims could benefit from Doug Martin’s 3 game suspension and solidify himself as an every game passing down back with a solid performance to open the season. His abysmal 2.9 yards per carry last season was balanced by his value in the receiving game, and he is worth a look late in PPR leagues - especially if you selected Martin - for his receiving value and extra workload early on.

**62.** **Jalen Richard - Oak:** Much said previously about DeAndre Washington could be repeated down here for Richard. An elusive back who is also an adept receiver, Richard could be a handcuff for Lynch and intriguing target late in drafts when options are thin. He is also a PPR value pick with 29 receptions last season, and his 5.9 yards per carry (on 83 touches) gives him high upside. He’s worth a late round pick if you’re thin at RB.

**63.** **Jonathan Williams - Buf:** - Starting running back LeSean McCoy has missed 6 games in last two seasons, and Mike Clay at ESPN noted that former backup Gillislee scored nine touchdowns on 110 touches in relief of McCoy last season. Williams is a valuable handcuff commodity with Gillislee off to New England, and will be a hot waiver wire pickup if McCoy gets injured midseason. Until then, don’t reach for Williams in drafts unless you need him as a McCoy handcuff or bench RB.

**64.** **Jerick McKinnon - Min:** McKinnon is now competing with both Latavius Murray and rookie Dalvin Cook in the Minnesota backfield after trying to battle Adrian Peterson for the last few seasons. McKinnon finds himself likely relegated to pass catching duties out of the backfield, as all of the hype is centered around Cook’s eventual overtake of Murray for the starting job. Keep an eye on what happens in Minnesota, but McKinnon is the odd man out in this group of three.

**65.** **Ryan Mathews - Phi:** Mathews is part of an extremely crowded Eagles backfield this season, as newcomer LeGarrette Blount adds his talents into the smorgasbord of Eagles’ backs. Blount will likely handle early down and short distance duties, while Sproles figures to remain the change of pace back. Wendell Smallwood and Donnell Pumphrey have also made names for themselves early on in the offseason, potentially leaving Mathews the odd man out. Keep an eye on the Philadelphia RB situation before selecting him.

**66.** **Shane Vereen - NYG:** Vereen had a solid 4.8 yards per carry last year during his limited time on the field, and added in his known passing game ability to the tune of 11 receptions for 94 yards. Injuries proved to be his downfall, and he lost much time last season and is now behind second year Paul Perkins on the depth chart. Vereen could still play a role in the passing game, but he’s worth no more than a late handcuff for fantasy purposes, and only in PPR leagues.

**67.** **D’Onta Foreman - Hou:** The bruising rookie out of Texas figures to be a competitive backup for Lamar Miller down in Houston this season. We’ve yet to see what the Texans’ offense will look like - or even who will actually play quarterback - but Foreman has potential as a handcuff to Miller and late round draft pick in many fantasy formats.

**68.** **Chris Ivory - Jac** Ivory struggled in Jacksonville’s offense last year after coming from New York, and the Jaguars added rookie sensation Leonard Fournette early in the first round this year to address the RB position. Ivory figures to be relegated to short distance or goal line duties as TJ Yeldon should figure to get more receiving targets, making Ivory little more than a deep league handcuff this season.

**69.** **Robert Turbin - Ind:** Turbin backs up the ageless Frank Gore for the Colts, but has rookie draft pick Marlon Mack breathing down his neck to start off the season. Gore is very durable, and Mack is an intriguing rookie who should get some looks this season. Turbin is little more than a Gore handcuff, and when’s the last time you rostered one of those?

**70.** **TJ Yeldon - Jac:** Yeldon will lose time to rookie Leonard Fournette this season, but could have a role as a passing down back. He had 50 catches last season for over 300 yards, and is worth putting on your watch list in PPR leagues. However, he’s a risky pick to take on draft day.

Bell is one of the most utilized backs in football, but Conner will only play if he is completely unavailable.

He’s a long shot to be fantasy relevant, pending injuries - which could be in the cards with Hyde.

**75.** **Jeremy McNichols - TB:** Rookie Jeremy McNichols found himself in an interesting spot after the 2017 Draft, as Doug Martin is suspended to start the season and the only thing standing in front of him and playing time are Charles Sims and Jacquizz Rodgers. McNichols is a talented rookie who is very worth a late round flier, especially if you own Martin.

**77.** **Wayne Gallman - NYG:** Gallman is an intriguing rookie who joins a Giants backfield that is not necessarily threatening nor sparse. Paul Perkins has been (allegedly) given the starting role in New York, and Gallman is thus a shot in the dark for fantasy purposes this season.

## **_WR:_**


**1.** **Antonio Brown - Pit:** Brown had the second most receptions in the NFL last year despite seeing constant double or triple teams throughout the entirety of the season. He is an elite player who also returns punts (if your league counts return points at all), and should be off the board in the first half of every first round with confidence. He is poised for another huge season here in 2017.

**2.** **Odell Beckham, Jr. - NYG:** Odell Beckham receives more competition for targets this season in the form of veteran red zone vulture Brandon Marshall and huge rookie tight end-wide receiver combo player Evan Engram. Beckham, however, should partially counteract this dip in targets with an increase in productivity, as defenses will not be able to allocate as much attention to him as they have in years past. The Giants attempted almost 600 passes last season, meaning work will be bountiful enough to fulfill Beckham’s first round fantasy potential. Take him with confidence.

**3.** **Julio Jones - Atl:** Julio Jones is an elite talent that could - like the rest of the Atlanta offense - see a statistical dip this season due to the departure of Kyle Shanahan to San Francisco. Jones has played all 16 games only twice in his six-year NFL career, and new offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian has often had a more conservative passing tendency than the deeper-targeting offenses that have brought Jones more success. Despite the potential for regression in yardage, Jones is still a first round prospect in fantasy and will likely be again among the top receivers at the end of the season.

**4.** **Mike Evans - TB:** Evans saw an absurd 175 targets last season, and that is bound to elevate anyone to success in fantasy, but take note of the 96 receptions he had. If his catch percentage were even slightly higher, he would’ve been the pick of the year in last seasons’ fantasy drafts. While the Buccaneers added deep threat DeSean Jackson and rookie tight end OJ Howard this season, that should only open up coverage for Evans and allow him to catch more of those targets. Evans is one of the better available selections outside of the surefire top picks this year.

**5.** **AJ Green - Cin:** AJ Green is one of the most consistent wide receivers in football. Last season - when he played only 10 games - was the first in which he did not have over 1,000 yards in his entire six year career…and he still had 964. Green should benefit from the addition of speedster John Ross, as opposing defenses will now be forced to divert some attention to the home run threat as well as the pure receiving ability of Green. Green is a top level fantasy wide receiver, and should not fall too far this season in fantasy drafts.

**6.** **Jordy Nelson - GB:** Nelson was first in [ESPN's consistency ratings](http://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/page/consistency2016/final-2016-fantasy-football-consistency-ratings) in regards to start percentage, making him the most reliable receiver in fantasy last season. His value comes from not only catching passes from Aaron Rodgers, but the trust that Rodgers has in Nelson. Nelson had 29 red zone targets last season, including 15 inside 10, and posted 9 TD’S from inside the ten yard line. Nelson is a top level WR1 who tends to fall a bit too far in drafts, so if you’re at the end of the first/beginning of the second round, don’t hesitate to snag Nelson.

**7.** **Michael Thomas - NO:** Michael Thomas was the surprise of the fantasy world last season. He saw 11 targets from inside the ten yard line, and scored on 6 of them. He had at least 5 catches in 11 games (out of the 15 he played), and proved to be a reliable target in the league’s most potent passing offense as the Saints were the only team to throw for over 5,000 yards last year. With Brandin Cooks off to New England, Thomas now becomes the undisputed number one receiver in New Orleans. Mike Clay at ESPN noted that since Sean Payton and Drew Brees arrived in New Orleans in 2006, the target share (percentage of total team targets) of the team's top wide receiver during their 11 years of work is as follows: 20, 23, 19, 20, 20, 17, 20, 18, 16, 20, 19. Look for Thomas to have another explosive year as the targets - and the attention from opposing defenses - increase.

**8.** **TY Hilton - Ind:** Per last year’s [strength of schedule metrics](http://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/234722/2017-nfl-strength-of-schedule), the Colts have easiest schedule in 2017. TY Hilton averaged 117.9 receiving yards in games the Colts won (per Matthew Berry at ESPN), and has proven to be Luck’s favorite target with over 1,000 yards receiving in each of the last four seasons. Hilton is extremely reliable, and proves to be an reliable top end fantasy wide receiver year in and year out. He’s a WR1 without a doubt.

**9.** **Dez Bryant - Dal:** While the Cowboys as a whole had a very successful season last year, Bryant seemed to underperform for fantasy purposes. He has not played a full season since 2014, and had been held to 1,197 yards receiving in 2015 and 2016 combined. He is alleged to be a full go this season, and could thus be a nice sleeper pick towards the end of the second or through the third round, but it’s risky to rely on him as your WR1 at this point. High upside, but take with caution.

**10.** **Amari Cooper - Oak:** Cooper had 0 red zone TD’s last season on 13 red zone targets, but has been dominant despite only scoring 11 times in his first two seasons. However, he has had 1,000 yards in each of those seasons. He’s an effective targets and yards receiver in fantasy in the same mold as Julio Jones, and any touchdowns can be seen as a major bonus. With Carr signed to a large extension this offseason and the addition of Marshawn Lynch to the running game, expect Cooper to again put up large numbers through the air. He’s a reliable WR1 to own if you cannot snag one of the top level guys.

**11.** **Doug Baldwin - Sea:** Baldwin has had over 1,000 yards in each of the last two season and added a combined 172 receptions in that span to boot. While those are fringe WR1/WR2 numbers, Matthew Berry at ESPN noted that Russell Wilson's passing yardage total has increased every season of his career, and the addition of Eddie Lacy may only aid this fact. That said, don’t reach for Baldwin too high in drafts - as his volume in a potent passing attack is solid enough to be a low level WR1 or top level WR2 - but he is a reliable pick in the later second or third round.

| **11** | **_Doug Baldwin_** | 126     | 94 | 1,128 | 7 | 15 | 11 | 6 |



**12.** **DeAndre Hopkins - Hou:** Hopkins suffered from mediocre QB play last season, and had merely 1 red zone TD last season despite having 9 red zone targets. While Houston’s quarterback situation should be monitored closely in regards to selecting Hopkins in fantasy, what’s indisputable is the talent that Hopkins possesses on an every down basis. His 150 targets is staggering, and he should improve on his meager catch percentage whether Tom Savage or rookie DeShaun Watson is under center this year. Hopkins has high upside based on his draft position, but don’t reach for him too early.

| **12** | **_DeAndre Hopkins_** | 150     | 78 | 954 | 4 | 9 | 3 | 1 |



**13.** **Demaryius Thomas - Den:** Thomas has had over 1,000 yards receiving every season since 2011, and four of those five were seasons of 1,300 or more yards. Granted, Peyton Manning is a step or two up from Trevor Siemian/Paxton Lynch, but Thomas should prove to yet again be an important figure in the passing game. While touchdowns may be difficult to come by in Denver’s mediocre offense, volume keeps Thomas as a solid WR2 for fantasy purposes.

| **13** | **_Demaryius Thomas_** | 145     | 90 | 1,083 | 5 | 18 | 12 | 4 |



**14.** **Brandin Cooks - NE:** The center of offseason trade hype this season, Cooks sets off for defending champion New England, where he can pair with arguably one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time in Tom Brady. Brady led the NFL in vertical yards per attempt last season, which is ideal for Cooks’ skill set, and gives the receiver huge upside. While target competition and New England’s frequent decision to employ a short, quick passing game have been frequent antagonists to fantasy production, look for Cooks to defy the odds and have a big season while opening up New England’s already championship caliber offense.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **14** | **_Brandin Cooks_** | 117     | 78 | 1,173 | 8 | 11 | 10 | 3 |



**15.** **Sammy Watkins - Buf:** Sammy Watkins is extremely injury prone, but he is only 24 and is currently entering a contract year. He is averaging 7.8 targets per game (27 percent share) during the 32 games in which he has played at least 70 percent of the pass-play snaps (per Mike Clay at ESPN), exemplifying his value to the Buffalo offense as a whole. While the addition of rookie Zay Jones gives Watkins some competition for targets, the removal of Rex Ryan from the coaching staff should provide Buffalo with more passing attempts overall. Watkins is a risky WR2 in fantasy this season, but has WR1 upside if he can stay healthy.

| **15** | **_Sammy Watkins_** | 52     | 28 | 430 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 1 |



**16.** **Allen Robinson - Jac:** Robinson was a highly touted fantasy asset last season, ranked [13th overall and just behind Le'Veon Bell](http://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/id/16287927/2016-fantasy-football-rankings-top-300) before the year started, but disappointed all who drafted him while posting less than 900 receiving yards. Robinson had all the opportunity in the world, as he was 6th in the NFL in targets last year, 10th in the NFL in red zone targets, and 6th in the NFL in red zone touchdowns, per Field Yates at ESPN. Robinson should fall in drafts this season due to his regression last year, but the addition of Leonard Fournette should bolster the Jaguars offense as a whole, and Robinson could be the main beneficiary. He’s a high upside WR2 this season.

| **16** | **_Allen Robinson_** | 151     | 73 | 883 | 6 | 19 | 9 | 6 |



**17.** **Alshon Jeffery - Phi:** Jeffery should be one of the biggest beneficiaries of fantasy production due to team change in 2017. Joining the Eagles as Carson Wentz’s immediate number one target, Jeffery is sure to see a lot of work in an offense that threw the 6th most passes in the NFL last season (609), and the addition of LeGarrette Blount should help to open up the receiving game a little more than usual. Jeffery is a high upside WR2 in fantasy leagues this season, but keep in mind that he is quite injury prone (played two full seasons in his five year career).

| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **17** | **_Alshon Jeffery_** | 95     | 52 | 821 | 2 | 12 | 4 | 2 |



**18.** **Terrelle Pryor - Was** Terrelle Pryor has a great season last year as he posted over 1,000 yards in Cleveland with a starting quarterback combination of Josh McCown, Robert Griffin III, and Cody Kessler. He now joins a Redskins offense that lost both DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon in the offseason, and is looking for another passing threat to roll out besides Jamison Crowder and Jordan Reed. Matthew Berry at ESPN notes that in the past two seasons, only Matt Ryan has a better deep completion percentage than Kirk Cousins, which could pay off for Pryor. He’s a WR2 for fantasy purposes.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **18** | **_Terrelle Pryor_** | 140     | 77 | 1,007 | 4 | 13 | 9 | 4 |



**19.** **Davante Adams - GB:** Aaron Rodgers alone gives Adams a boost in fantasy circles, but he is a reliable receiver in his own right in one of the league’s best offenses. Adams saw 10 targets from inside the 10 last season and scored on 5 of them, and proved to be a valuable asset overall for Green Bay with 12 total receiving touchdowns. While often benefiting from less coverage as he is playing opposite of Jordy Nelson, Adams has the potential to put up big numbers while still providing a solid level of consistency. He’s a good WR2 to own in fantasy leagues.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **19** | **_Davante Adams_** | 121    | 75 | 997 | 12 | 20 | 12 | 7 |



**20.** **Keenan Allen - LAC:** Keenan Allen is an productive fantasy wide receiver when healthy, but in the mere four seasons since he’s left college, he has had a torn PCL, ACL, broken collarbone, lacerated kidney, and other smaller injuries holding him to 9 total games n the last two seasons combined. He also has a lot more receiving competition this year in Mike Williams and an emerging Hunter Henry, but Allen has proven himself as one of Rivers’ favorite targets when he is one the field. Allen is a risky player due to durability concerns, but don’t sleep on the talent here. If he stays healthy, he could be a low end WR2. But, that’s a big if.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **20** | **_Keenan Allen_** | 7     | 6 | 63 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |



**21.** **Michael Crabtree - Oak:** Crabtree finished tied for 10th in targets last season with 145, and looks to build on his 1,000 yard season last year in a dangerous Oakland passing attack. The addition of Marshawn Lynch adds an element to the running game that is impossible for opposing defenses to ignore, and Crabtree could benefit greatly from this. He is the Raiders’ main red zone threat - seeing 21 red zone targets last year - and is still a solid WR2 in fantasy leagues.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **21** | **_Michael Crabtree_** | 145     | 89 | 1,003 | 8 | 21 | 12 | 6 |



**22.** **Golden Tate - Det:** Golden Tate is a high volume receiver in an offense that ranked 11th in the NFL last season in total passing attempts (594). He has seen at least 128 targets every season since coming to Detroit in 2014, and is one of Matthew Stafford’s most reliable receivers. Per Mike Clay at ESPN, he has been on the field for at least 87 percent of his team's snaps (one season with Seattle, three with Detroit) and handled at least 21 percent of the targets in four consecutive seasons. Tate’s score last season could have been much higher if he had reeled in more targets in the red zone, as he caught 1 touchdown inside the 20 despite 17 total red zone targets. With touchdown vulture Anquan Boldin gone and the volume to still be plentiful, look for Tate to be a borderline WR2 in PPR leagues this season, especially if his touchdown total goes up (it should).


| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **22** | **_Golden Tate_** | 135     | 91 | 1,077 | 4 | 17 | 9 | 1 |



**23.** **Emmanuel Sanders - Den:** Sanders suffered from poor QB play last season (as did the Broncos as a whole), but is also very reliable in fantasy. He has missed only 1 game in his 3 seasons in Denver, and Matthew Berry at ESPN noted that Sanders has 16 different games with at least 20 PPR points since 2014, and only Antonio Brown, Julio Jones, Odell Beckham Jr have more of those games in that span. While Trevor Siemian/Paxton Lynch limited him to a 2016 catch rate of only 58.1% and only 8 games of 50 or more yards receiving, Sanders still put up over 1,000 yards due to his high volume and target share (139 targets on the season). Sanders can be a solid WR2 in PPR leagues, but is worth slightly less in leagues that score nothing for receptions.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **23** | **_Emmanuel Sanders_** | 139     | 79 | 1,032 | 5 | 18 | 8 | 3 |


**24.** **Jarvis Landry - Mia:** Jarvis Landry put up over 1,100 yards last season on 136 targets despite playing in a Miami offense with the second lowest amount of passing attempts in the entire NFL (477). The resigning of Kenny Stills and offseason talk-up of Devante Parker gives Landry target competition that he is not used to, but it should also take some attention off of him, as well. Touchdowns could be hard to come by, as Jay Ajayi has proven to be a powerful runner and was given the 9th most carries on the season despite not solidifying the starting job until week 5, but Landry is a monster in PPR leagues and is thus a WR2 in such.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |
| ------------- | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:|
| **24** | **_Jarvis Landry_** | 131     | 94 | 1,136 | 4 | 9 | 7 | 2 |



**25.** **Tyreek Hill - KC:** An intriguing prospect last season, Tyreek Hill burst onto the scene as an effective receiver, rusher, and return man. Jeremy Maclin is out in KC, and Hill now moves into the spotlight of the passing offense along with tight end Travis Kelce. How he will be utilized this season remains to be seen, but expect Hill to be reliant on a few different things, including (but not limited to) deep or long distance receptions/touchdowns, sporadically long distance rushing attempts, and the occasional return touchdown. Hill varies widely by league in terms of fantasy value, as he saw only 83 targets last season, but that number figures to go up with Maclin’s departure. Take a special note of Hill if you play in leagues that count A. Big play bonuses (in any fashion), or B. Return yards (in any fashion). Otherwise, don’t reach for him too high…at least until we hear anything about his potential usage from Kansas City.

| **25** | **_Tyreek Hill_** | 83     | 61 | 593 | 6 | 13 | 10 | 3 |



**26.** **Martavis Bryant - Pit:** Bryant is coming off of a yearlong suspension, but his return is widely anticipated. Per Mike Clay at ESPN, he has been on the field for at least 70 percent of the team's pass plays during 12 of his 24 career games (11 of which came in 2015). During those 12 showings, Bryant handled 9.5 targets per game (25 percent share). Matthew Berry noted that last season Steelers wide receivers not named Antonio Brown combined for 102 catches, 1,481 yards and 11 touchdowns. The 15 touchdowns Bryant has in his 21 career games shows that Ben Roethlisberger trusts Bryant as a target, and thus Bryant should not be left to far in fantasy drafts, pending a solid preseason/not getting into trouble. He could have a big season, and is a more attractive pick than many other receivers.

| **26** | **_Martavis Bryant_** | 0     | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |



**27.** **Larry Fitzgerald - Ari:** Larry Fitzgerald has consistently been of the most reliable wide receivers in fantasy football. He has missed 6 games in his entire career (13 seasons), and has had over 1,000 yards in 8 of those seasons (including the last two). With the Cardinals passing attack being such a significant part of their game plan in 2016 (646 passing attempts, 3rd in the NFL), expect Fitzgerald to again be a reliable fantasy receiver - especially in PPR formats. John Brown returning to health should help to draw a bit of attention away from Fitzgerald, and we can expect to see Fitzgerald to remain in his usage of 150 targets last season. He’s a reliable WR2/WR3 (more valuable in PPR leagues) that is worth taking over a riskier option at this point in the draft.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **27** | **_Larry Fitzgerald_** | 150     | 107 | 1,023 | 6 | 20 | 13 | 4 |



**28.** **Julian Edelman - NE:** Edelman has been a favorite target of Tom Brady’s for some time, as he has seen at least 134 targets in 3 of the last 4 seasons, save for the 2015 season in which he played only 9 games due to injury. Edelman is a high floor, low ceiling prospect who does much better in PPR formats, as touchdowns in the New England offense are tough to come by for wide receivers. With at least 972 yards in each of the 3 full seasons he has played out of the last four, Edelman remains a solid PPR target and WR3 in non-PPR scoring leagues.


| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **28** | **_Julian Edelman_** | 158     | 98 | 1,106 | 3 | 15 | 6 | 2 |



**29.** **Jamison Crowder - Was:** Jamison Crowder burst onto the fantasy scene last season, with 97 targets despite competing for passes with DeSean Jackson, Pierre Garcon, and Jordan Reed. Jackson and Garcon are gone this season, meaning there are 203 targets up for grabs this season in Washington between the two. The addition of Terrelle Pryor should actually help Crowder’s fantasy potential, as defensive attention will be less focused on him in the wake of the departure of the aforementioned Jackson and Garcon. Crowder is a great PPR selection as a WR3, especially if your league counts return yards, as he also returned some punts last season.


| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **29** | **_Jamison Crowder_** | 97     | 67 | 847 | 7 | 16 | 9 | 3 |



**30.** **Stefon Diggs - Min:** The conservative nature of the Vikings offense has hampered Diggs for fantasy purposes, but he still put up 903 yards last season on 111 targets. While red zone targets are hard to come by (12 on the season) and touchdowns to wide receivers are scarce, Diggs is the number one receiver in an offense that threw the 12th most passes in the NFL last season at 588. Volume makes Diggs a WR3 for fantasy purposes, but don’t reach for him, as touchdowns have proven difficult to come by in the conservative Minnesota offense.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **30** | **_Stefon Diggs_** | 111     | 84 | 903 | 3 | 12 | 11 | 1 |



**31.** **Willie Snead - NO:** Willie Snead had a solids season last year playing as the third receiver in New Orleans’ league leading passing attack, and his fantasy stock should improve with the trade of Brandin Cooks to the Patriots. While Ten Ginn comes to town in his place, Ginn is more of a straight line speedster, and Snead should now be number two behind Michael Thomas in Drew Brees’ 2017 passing spray chart. Due to this, Snead should see his targets increase a bit from the 104 he had last season, and is a good WR3 to own this year in what should be another big season from Drew Brees and the Saints passing attack.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |
| ------------- | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:| -----:|
| **31** | **_Willie Snead_** | 104     | 72 | 895 | 4 | 12 | 8 | 4 |



**32.** **Donte Moncrief - Ind:** Donte Moncrief is a difficult projection to make in any preseason ranking, as his touchdown potential and injury potential go hand in hand to form a dangerous predictive duo. Moncrief had 6 red zone TD’s on 10 red zone targets last season…on six total targets. Per Mike Clay at ESPN, he has had 11 TD’s in 15 games with Andrew Luck in last two seasons, and was on the field for at least 70 percent of the team's pass plays in 18 games…and he averaged 7.8 targets per game (21 percent share) during that span. Moncrief is a risky pick with high upside, and is a great selection as a WR3 or flex player with upside.  

| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **32** | **_Donte Moncrief_** | 56     | 30 | 307 | 7 | 10 | 8 | 6 |


**33.** **Kelvin Benjamin - Car:** Kelvin Benjamin had over 900 yards and 7 receiving touchdowns in a stumbling Carolina offense after his missed 2015 season, but it is difficult to gauge how his 2017 production will pan out. The Panthers added Christian McCaffrey and Curtis Samuel - who are both competent rushers and receivers - in the NFL Draft this year, and much is to be discovered about the roses each will play in the offense. Benjamin, however, is still the number one receiver in a Carolina offense that should regress this season, making him a nice upside fantasy play as a WR3 this year.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **33** | **_Kelvin Benjamin_** | 118     | 63 | 941 | 7 | 15 | 8 | 5 |



**34.** **DeSean Jackson - TB:** Jackson joins a rebooted Tampa Bay offense that is looking a lot more dangerous than in previous years, and could benefit from the diverted attention. Jackson is a deep ball receiver, and thus a boom or bust fantasy prospect, but has proven to be effective in his time in the NFL. While those in leagues that target big plays in the form of extra points should pay extra attention to Jackson, those in regular PPR or regular non-PPR leagues should at least be aware of his weekly variance in point production before drafting him. Jackson is a solid WR3, as during his good weeks he will put up WR1 numbers. The bust weeks, however, are what keeps him at WR3.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **34** | **_DeSean Jackson_** | 97     | 67 | 847 | 7 | 16 | 9 | 3 |



**35.** **Brandon Marshall - NYG:** Brandon Marshall switches sides in New York this season, joining a Giants passing attack that is known for rolling out three receiver formations more than any other team in recent years. Thus, Marshall should get a ton of work despite target competition from Odell Beckham, Jr., Sterling Shepard, and rookie tight end Evan Engram. Per Matthew Berry at ESPN, Marshall leads all NFL wideouts with 35 red zone scores since 2012, and the big wideout looks to be Manning’s prime target in the end zone this season, as well. While he will no doubt be playing second fiddle to OBJ (and reaping the benefits of less attention from defenses along with it), do not sleep on Marshall in fantasy drafts this season. He could get a lot of scores as well as targets. He’s a high upside WR3.


| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **35** | **_Brandon Marshall_** | 128     | 59 | 788 | 3 | 21 | 7 | 4 |



**36.** **Pierre Garcon - SF:** Garcon moves to the 49ers this season to reunite with Kyle Shanahan, his former coordinator in Washington, with whom he had great success. Garcon led the NFL in receptions (with 113) the last time he played with Shanahan in 2013, and his target share should be large enough again this season to have him right back there again. Despite a seemingly lackluster offense, Brian Hoyer is a decent quarterback who can deliver reliable results when healthy. He should be able to get Garcon the ball often this season, and garbage time can do wonders for fantasy wide receivers when the Niners get down early. He’s much more valuable in PPR leagues, but Garcon is a high upside WR3 this season as he heads the 49ers receiving corps.


| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **36** | **_Pierre Garcon_** | 116     | 79 | 1,041 | 3 | 13 | 5 | 1 |



**37.** **Eric Decker - Ten:** Decker signed a late contract with Tennessee after being released by the Jets, and could see major value in fantasy as a possession receiver in Tennessee, with the emerging Marcus Mariota under center. Matthew Berry at ESPN noted that Decker was third in the NFL in red zone receptions and second in red zone touchdowns from 2012 until 2015, and Mariota is well known for his red zone prowess. While Decker has a lot of potential, the target competition in Tennessee is fierce this season, returning the pass catchers from last year while adding new ones in the draft (including 5th overall pick Corey Davis). He could be a reliable receiver this season, but it is too variable at this point in the offseason to say for sure what Decker’s role will be. He’s still worth a look in fantasy as a flex play in drafts.

| **37** | **_Eric Decker_** | 21     | 9 | 194 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 2 |



**38.** **Jeremy Maclin - Bal:** Maclin had a tough season in Kansas City last year, putting up only 536 yards on 76 targets, but could see a big improvement this season in the league’s most  pass heavy offense over the last two seasons. With Mike Wallace and Danny Woodhead to take targets and defensive attention away, look for Maclin’s numbers to increase significantly this season from his down year in KC. He’s a solid flex player this year, and could be even higher if he reels in a nice catch percentage for his (presumed) plethora of targets.

| **38** | **_Jeremy Maclin_** | 76     | 44 | 536 | 2 | 9 | 4 | 2 |



**39.** **DeVante Parker - Mia:** Parker is an intriguing player this season in fantasy circles, and part of that has stemmed from the uptalk he has received from both players and coaches down in Miami. He actually had an equivalent starting percentage to Brandin Cooks and Golden Tate last year according to [ESPN's consistency ratings](http://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/page/consistency2016/final-2016-fantasy-football-consistency-ratings), and that was in a season in which he was only targeted 90 times. While the resigned Kenny Stills should take away targets from Parker, Jarvis Landry will draw away both targets and defensive coverage. Parker could be a solid WR3 this season, especially if he starts to see more red zone targets (2 of his 4 touchdowns came in the red zone).

| **39** | **_DeVante Parker_** | 90     | 56 | 744 | 4 | 8 | 5 | 2 |



**40.** **Tyrell Wiliams - LAC:** Tyrell Williams was 18th in PPR fantasy points among wide receivers and had over 1,000 yards last year for a struggling Chargers team. While the team drafted rookie Mike Williams (who is currently dealing with an injury) and has another end zone target in Hunter Henry, Tyrell Williams preserves his role on the team after a breakout season last year. Tyrell Williams should be a valuable later round pick, as he established himself as a reliable target behind the injury prone Keenan Allen.

| **40** | **_Tyrell Williams_** | 120     | 69 | 1,059 | 7 | 16 | 9 | 2 |



**41.** **Cameron Meredith - Chi:** Cameron Meredith was a surprise on the Bears’ offense last season, putting up 888 yards on 96 targets in a subpar offense. The Bears passing attack as a whole should be slightly better this season, with Mike Glennon coming in to throw and Kevin White having the entire offseason to get healthy. Meredith could reap the benefits of this, as the targets have to go somewhere. Touchdowns will be hard to come by, but he’s a top receiver on a poor offense, and is thus worth a spot on your roster as a WR3 or flex player.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **41** | **_Cameron Meredith_** | 96     | 66 | 888 | 4 | 12 | 6 | 1 |



**42.** **John Brown - Ari:** John Brown should be returning fully healthy this season, and he could be a very sneaky fantasy pick due to it. In his last healthy season (2015), he had 6 catches over 40 yards, and Mike Clay at ESPN pointed out that Brown was averaging 6.9 targets per game (20 percent share) during the 35 games in which he has played at least 70 percent of the pass-play snaps. As the number two receiver in an Arizona passing offense that threw 646 passes last season (3rd most), Brown is an intriguing sleeper pick this year. He’s got WR3 upside, and is a great value down this low.


| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **42** | **_John Brown_** | 72     | 39 | 517 | 2 | 6 | 2 | 1 |



**43.** **Kenny Britt - Cle:** The new starting receiver in Cleveland, Britt’s landing spot alone could result in enough targets for a good season. Terrell Pryor had over 1,000 yards with much worse QB play (and a worse line blocking for him) than Britt will have, and the entire Browns offense should have a much different look this season than in years past. Britt won’t blow the doors off the stadium, but he should be another reliable play as a flex or low level WR3 this season due to volume alone.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **43** | **_Kenny Britt_** | 111     | 68 | 1,002 | 5 | 11 | 6 | 4 |



**44.** **Randall Cobb - GB:** As a starting receiver in one of the best offenses in football, it is interesting to observe the path that Randall Cobb’s stats have taken over the past few seasons. His 1,287 yard breakout in 2014 was followed by 829 yards in 2015 and a mere 610 last season, and it is difficult to pinpoint why. He’s a tough asset to locate this season in fantasy drafts, but he’s worth a late round flier due to his solidified place in the Green Bay offense and the fact that he has shown flashes of greatness before. Don’t trust him as anything higher than a flex play, but he’s a flex play that could have some good upside.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **44** | **_Randall Cobb_** | 84     | 60 | 610 | 4 | 13 | 9 | 4 |



**45.** **Mike Wallace - Bal:** No team has attempted more pass attempts than the Ravens in each of the past two seasons, and Steve Smith has been replaced by Jeremy Maclin. Danny Woodhead has also been added to the backfield, but all of this should only benefit Mike Wallace. Matthew Berry at ESPN noted that in the 8 seasons he has played in the NFL, Wallace has posted a top-30 WR fantasy finish 7 times. That is simply astounding for a player who was known as a speedster early in his career and seems to have fallen off the face of the fantasy earth in recent years. Despite that, Wallace put up over 1,000 yards last season on 117 targets. Flacco should be throwing early and often again this season, and look for Wallace to be a main beneficiary. Despite the fact that he is not being drafted like it, Wallace is a good flex/WR3 - especially in PPR leagues.

| **45** | **_Mike Wallace_** | 117     | 72 | 1,017 | 4 | 9 | 5 | 2 |


**46.** **Corey Coleman - Cle:** Coleman broke his hand halfway through the season (in practice) and missed a chunk of his rookie year due to such. He showed some flashes of greatness that made him the first wide receiver taken in 2016, but he reeled in only 33 of 74 targets on the year. As much of that can be said of the quarterbacks under center as it can be about Coleman, but the QB position should (hopefully) be improved over last year and Coleman’s numbers should jump to solid flex play or low level WR3 numbers. He is a good pickup in leagues that count big play bonuses, as speed is one of his major strongpoints.

| **46** | **_Corey Coleman_** | 74     | 33 | 413 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 |



**47.** **Adam Thielen - Min:** Adam Thielen is probably most remembered for his 202 yard, 2 touchdown performance in the fantasy championship week last season, but he should be looked upon this year as a reliable target in a conservative Minnesota offense. Bradford developed a nice rapport with Thielen throughout the course of the season, and expect his targets to be well over 100 this season working opposite of Stefon Diggs - who should draw the majority of the attention from opposing secondaries. He’s a decent flex play this year due to target volume, especially in PPR leagues, but expect his up and down trend of scoring on a weekly basis to continue.


| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **47** | **_Adam Thielen_** | 92     | 69 | 967 | 5 | 10 | 8 | 3 |



**48.** **Corey Davis - Ten** Davis is a dynamic rookie who should be fully healthy and ready to go following offseason surgery, and joins a dangerous Titans offense that could turn a lot of heads this season. Davis could become an immediate contributor in Tennessee, and could be a late round steal in fantasy leagues - if he falls that far. Expect there to be a lot of hype around Corey Davis, especially after solid rookie performances in recent years (think Michael Thomas), but he’s a great upside pick to add to your group of wide receivers towards the middle to later end of the draft.

**49.** **Rishard Matthews - Ten:** Rishard Matthews had one of the most interesting fantasy seasons of all wide receivers last year. He had no more than 4 catches in any single game until week 9, but did well on the year as a whole with 9 receiving touchdowns and 945 yards. Matthews is in an interesting situation in Tennessee, where he now faces target competition from newcomers Eric Decker and rookie sensation Corey Davis, as well as other rookies in the form of Taywan Taylor and Jonnu Smith. Don’t expect a repeat of last season for Matthews in the touchdown department, but he could approach the 800-900 yard range again. He’s a good bench receiver for your fantasy team.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **49** | **_Rishard Matthews_** | 108     | 65 | 945 | 9 | 15 | 12 | 7 |



**50.** **Quincy Enunwa - NYJ:** Quincy Enunwa is the current number one receiver for the New York Jets, as both Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker are gone and QB position should be (slightly) improved with McCown starting (for now). Enunwa put up respectable numbers last year on 106 targets, and he could surpass those numbers this year without Marshall and Decker in the mix. His touchdowns will most likely not improve due to the mediocre quality of the Jets offense as a whole, but Enunwa could be a sleeper pick later in drafts due to his presumed volume.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **50** | **_Quincy Enunwa_** | 106     | 58 | 857 | 4 | 15 | 6 | 1 |



**51.** **Jordan Matthews - Phi** Recent additions to the Philadelphia passing attack could prove to be more beneficial than detrimental to Matthews this season. Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith - as well as running back LeGarrette Blount - join an Eagles offense that threw 609 passes last season, 6th most in the NFL. While that number should dip a bit due to the addition of Blount, expect there to be plenty of targets to go around, and a lot of attention now diverted away from Matthews and onto Jeffery and deep threat Torrey Smith. Matthews is a good value deep into drafts that could be left to fall, and should still see enough targets to be fantasy relevant as a flex play or potentially even a WR3 if he can get a few more looks in the end zone.

**52.** **Marvin Jones - Det:** Marvin Jones exploded for 408 yards receiving in the first 3 games of last year, but didn’t have another 100 yard game for the rest of the season. While he had a solid 103 targets in a respectable Detroit passing offense, he shouldn’t be counted on to produce those numbers from the early weeks of 2016 again. He can be a reliable flex receiver in PPR leagues, but don’t count on him for all that much more than that.

**53.** **Ted Ginn - NO:** Speedster Ted Ginn comes to New Orleans from division rival Carolina, and hopes to replace Brandin Cooks (by position alone) as the deep ball threat for the Saints. Drew Brees could send some of the thousand plus yards he’s fed Cooks in the each of the last two years to Ginn, but Michael Thomas is the #1 receiver here. Ginn is most valuable in leagues that count big play bonuses, and less valued in PPR leagues.

| **53** | **_Ted Ginn_** | 95     | 54 | 752 | 4 | 1 | 1 | 0 |



**54.** **Sterling Shepard - NYG:** The Giants are notorious for their frequent deployment of three receiver sets, and this season will get even more interesting with Brandon Marshall and rookie tight end Evan Engram added to the mix. Shepard should still see a decent volume of work, but may not hit the 100 target plateau like he did last year. His red zone targets (12, on which he scored 6 of his 8 touchdowns) should also be poached by both Marshall and Engram. Regardless, he will be on the field often, and is thus a worthy late round look in fantasy drafts.

| **54** | **_Sterling Shepard_** | 105     | 65 | 683 | 8 | 12 | 9 | 6 |



**55.** **Josh Doctson - Was:** With Pierre Garcon and DeSean Jackson both gone, Doctson should see a massive uptick in targets. He could take over a similar role to Garcon, who had 111 targets last year, and is a great sleeper pick this lateen the draft. Keep in mind that he is injury prone, however, and that Terrelle Pryor and Jamison Crowder are solidified as the top two on the depth chart.

**56.** **Breshad Perriman - Bal:** Perriman averaged 15.1 yards per catch last season, and the Ravens’ pass happy offense only helps his role as a late round sleeper pick for fantasy leagues. The signing of Jeremy Maclin dropped his stock a bit, but Perriman should still see plenty of work this season compared to his mere 66 targets a year ago. There’s receivers with much higher upside, but Perriman is a solid bench receiver.

| **56** | **_Breshad Perriman_** | 66     | 33 | 499 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 1 |



**57.** **Robert Woods - LAR:** Robert Woods could be this year’s Kenny Britt - the only guy to throw to for the LA Rams. Jared Goff should be settling in more as a pro quarterback, and Sean McVay’s offense could be a catalyst to improved passing based on his past work. He was respectable on his mere 74 targets in Buffalo last year, and should improve in an offense where he is featured more often. Woods is falling vey late, and, as a starting receiver, is worth the upside.

**58.** **Kevin White - Chi:** White is falling incredibly far for someone of his caliber and team situation. Alshon Jeffery has moved on, and Cameron Meredith is the only other receiver standing in White’s way in Chicago this season. The only thing he has to do is remain healthy - which he has proven as an insurmountable task since being drafted 7th overall just two years ago. White is a great sleeper pick deep into drafts, pending he stays healthy.

**59.** **Kenny Stills - Mia:** Stills was extended in the offseason after a 9 touchdown performance last season, but it was fairly surprising considering his mere 81 targets. He shouldn’t repeat those touchdowns and is still behind Jarvis Landry and Devante Parker on the depth chart, but he’s a decent flier to take later in the draft in hoping that the Dolphins extended him for a reason.

**60.** **Tyler Lockett - Sea:** Lockett saw only 67 targets last season, but should be more involved (if he can remain healthy) in a solid Seattle passing attack. He is a very talented player that is a danger with the ball in his hands, and could be worth a lot higher than the spot he currently holds. That said, don’t reach too high for him. He’s a risky bench receiver.

**61.** **Zay Jones - Buf:** Rookie Zay Jones steps in alongside Sammy Watkins in a Buffalo offense that is sure to throw more this season now that Rex Ryan is out of the picture. He could be utilized as a reliable possession receiver as most defenses’ attention will be going to Watkins, but only time will tell how much. He’s got decent upside in PPR leagues, but not much more than that.

**62.** **JJ Nelson - Ari:** JJ Nelson should be impeded by the healthy return of John Brown, and when looking at his stats from last season it is apparent that he is not a reliable fantasy asset. Four of his six touchdowns came in the red zone, and he caught only 34 passes across the entire season. He is not exactly a reliable fantasy receiver this year.

**63.** **Marqise Lee - Jac:** Marqise Lee quietly had 105 targets last season, and put up 851 yards to go along with 3 touchdowns. The Jaguars now have a running game behind Leonard Fournette, and Lee could improve along with the offense as a whole.  While Blake Bortles’ struggles haven’t helped Lee much and his tendency to get injured doesn’t help him either, Lee is a good sleeper pick late in drafts his season.

**64.** **Cole Beasley - Dal:** Cole Beasley caught 75 of his 98 targets, and had the highest red zone touchdown conversion rate in the NFL by putting up 5 scores on 8 targets. Mike Clay at ESPN noted that Beasley played 58 percent of Dallas' snaps, including 75 percent of pass plays, and handled 20 percent of the targets. Beasley is a solid flex play in PPR leagues, but little more than a bench player otherwise.

**65.** **John Ross - Cin:** - John Ross will line up across from AJ Green and give the Bengals the deep threat they have not had in recent seasons. While there is competition for targets in Cincinnati from tight end Tyler Eifert, Tyler Boyd, and veteran Brandon LaFell, the Bengals didn’t take him top ten to not throw to him. Ross is a good pick late in leagues that offer big play bonuses.

**66.** **Malcolm Mitchell - NE:** Brandin Cooks coming to New England hurt Mitchell’s fantasy chances tremendously. While he did perform well at the end of last season and caught 32 of his 48 targets, Mitchell has to compete with a plethora of weapons on the New England offense to get touches at all. He’s barely on fantasy radar at draft time this season.

**67.** **Will Fuller V - Hou:** Fuller has broken his collarbone in training camp, and hampers his ability to improve on his 635 yard season from a year ago. While it remains to be seen how Houston’s quarterback situation will play out, Fuller was a big play receiver who also returned some kicks and punts on special teams. Take note of Fuller’s injury status before selecting him this year, but he’s worth little more than a bench spot regardles.

**68.** **Tavon Austin - LAR:** Tavon Austin caught only 58 of his 107 targets in 2016, but the Rams’ passing attack should be significantly improved this season and rejuvenated under new coach Sean McVay. Austin is sort of a jack of all trades, and tough to gauge for fantasy purposes on a weekly basis, but he is barely reliable in most formats due to his low yardage production. Wait to see how he is going to be utilized before investing too much in him.

**69.** **Allen Hurns - Jac:** Allen Hurns was a victim of touchdown regression last season, and his 477 yards on 76 targets represented a significant downturn from his previous season. Hurns now finds himself battling with Marqise Lee for targets alongside Allen Robinson, and is also relying on Blake Bortles to reliably and consistently get him the ball. Hurns is a reach in fantasy leagues this season.

**70.** **Taylor Gabriel - Atl:** Gabriel had 579 yards on only 35 receptions last season, and he really picked up toward the end of the year. He’s a big play threat in a powerful Atlanta offense, and while the passing attack as a whole should regress a bit from their dominant 2016, they are still a formidable unit. Gabriel is especially useful in big play bonus leagues, as Matthew Berry at ESPN noted that one of every seven receptions he had last season went for at least 30 yards. Gabriel is a flex play with upside, but he could be a popular pick, so don’t reach for him too high.

**71.** **Mike Williams - LAC:** Mike Williams is a highly recognized rookie who figures to be an immediate factor in the Chargers’ passing attack this season - if he is healthy. In an offense not short of options, he poses a big red zone target to help replace the aging Antonio Gates. He’s an intriguing late round pick that has both injury risk and touchdown upside.

**72.** **Devin Funchess - Car:** Funchess suffered from a struggling offense overall last season, but should rise along with the rest of the Panthers in 2017. He won’t be worth fantasy gold by any means, but his targets, receptions, and yards should all increase with Ted Ginn’s departure. Funchess is worth no more than a late round flier this year, but he should see a lot more work than last year.

**73.** **Robby Anderson - NYJ:** Anderson is an intriguing sleeper pick this season, putting up 242 yards in his last 3 games last season. While the Jets offense as a whole should struggle this season - directly affecting Anderson’s potential in fantasy production, Anderson could benefit from lack of target competition. He’s an intriguing PPR sleeper pick, and worth a look late in the draft.

**74.** **Eli Rogers - Pit:** Rogers is hurt by the return of Martavis Bryant and drafting of rookie Juju Smith-Schuster, as he should lose some of his already limited targets to them. He’s barely worth targeting in fantasy leagues unless as a deep league late round reach.

**75.** **Mohamed Sanu - Atl:** Sanu remains entrenched as the number two wideout behind Julio Jones in a potent Atlanta passing attack, yet struggles to produce big fantasy numbers. He’s more of a possession type receiver best suited to be kept on the fantasy bench.

**76.** **Nelson Agholor - Phi:** Agholor had a tough season last year, putting up less than 400 yards on 70 targets. Word out of Philly training camp is that Agholor is doing very well, and could see a lot of snaps in the slot (Jordan Matthews’ usual role). While Agholor could benefit from an uptick in targets, don’t believe media hype until you see it on the field. While Agholor can hold some deep round sleeper appeal, keep in mind that he had 0 red zone touchdowns last season on 14 targets, and caught just barely over 50% of his targets last season.

**77.** **Michael Floyd - Min:** Floyd is the third receiver in a conservative Minnesota offense, and thus has tough competition for targets that are fantasy relevant. He’s best left alone on draft day except in deeper leagues.

**78.** **Curtis Samuel - Car:** Samuel is an intriguing rookie out of Ohio State who doubled as a Percy Harvin-type of running back/wide receiver combo player on offense. He joins Christian McCaffrey as a dual threat type of player on the Carolina offense, and has some upside as it’s yet to be seen how he’ll be used. That said, he’s worth no more than a late round flier.

**79.** **Chris Hogan - NE:** Hogan sees a lot of target competition this year in New England, and his stats from last year should dip down a bit. Seeing as they were already barely fantasy relevant anyway, there are better options than Hogan in redraft leagues as of right now.

**80.** **Kendall Wright - Chi:** Wright joins a mediocre Bears offense where Cameron Meredith and Kevin White figure to compete for targets (along with tight end Zach Miller). Wright isn’t the best fantasy option on draft day.

**_Unranked Receivers That Could Make an Impact_**

**Cooper Kupp - LAR:** Rookie Cooper Kupp was highly touted coming into this year’s NFL Draft, and the Rams bit on the hype in the third round. Kupp should step into a role where he can contribute immediately alongside Tavon Austin and Robert Woods. Known as a Julian Edelman or Wes Welker type of possession receiver, Kupp could generate flex numbers in PPR if he is offered the opportunity in the Rams’ mediocre offense.

**Tyler Boyd - Cin:** Boyd should be affected by John Ross’ drafting into the Cincinnati receiving room, but could see a reliable possession type role emerges this season. He’s worth putting on your watch list as he had 603 yards last season on 81 targets.

**Kenny Golladay - Det.** Rookie Kenny Golladay should see some immediate work in Detroit’s offense. He’ll start off behind Marvin Jones and Golden Tate, but he’s a reliable receiver that could make an impact in his first season.

**Torrey Smith - Phi.** Torrey Smith heads to the Eagles this season to join Alshon Jeffery and Jordan Matthews at receiver. He’s a deep ball threat, and thus worth a look in leagues with big play bonuses, but not much more than that.

**Braxton Miller - Hou.** Miller could benefit from Will Fuller’s broken collarbone, and should move up draft boards because of it. Keep an eye on him late in the draft.

**Brandon LaFell - Cin:** LaFell quietly put up 862 receiving yards on 106 targets last year. While John Ross and Tyler Boyd give him stiff competition, he could still be the reliable veteran presence he has been throughout his career.

**Laquon Treadwell - Min.** The most highly touted receiver of last year’s receiving class in the NFL Draft, Treadwell could see a big rise in production this year. However, Stefon Diggs and Adam Thielen have the receiving jobs in Minnesota fairly locked up.

**Josh Gordon - Cle.** Pending reinstatement, Gordon could be a WR2 or even WR1. Odds are, he won’t be reinstated. Just keep an eye on his situation throughout the season.



## **_TE:_**


**1.** **Rob Gronkowski - NE:** Gronkowski is arguably the greatest tight end of all time, and he definitely lives up to that billing in fantasy. He’s very injury prone, but gives your team a legitimate chance to win every single time he steps on the field. He is allegedly a full go in 2017, and while its not smart to reach for him too early in the draft, he should be gone by the end of the second round, and rightfully so.

| **1** | **_Rob Gronkowski_** | 38   | 25 | 540 | 3 | 5 | 2 | 1 |



**2.** **Travis Kelce - KC:** Travis Kelce was the leading tight end last season, and he should see an uptick in targets with Maclin gone. The conservative Chiefs offense fed Kelce for 1,125 yards last year despite only 4 touchdowns, and Kelce again should be a focal point of the passing game in Kansas City. Look for Kelce to again be a top 5 tight end, but don’t go chasing his stats from last year as he is sure to regress a bit.

| **2** | **_Travis Kelce_** | 117   | 85 | 1,125 | 4 | 16 | 8 | 3 |



**3.** **Greg Olsen - Car:** Olsen led Panthers with 129 targets last year, and is a prime candidate to do so again in 2017. Second and third in targets were Kelvin and Ted Ginn (who is off to New Orleans), and while the Panthers added two pass catching running back/wide receivers in the draft in the form of Christian McCaffrey and Curtis Samuel, Olsen should still be a top tight end in fantasy this year, and is a reliable pick as he has not missed a game since 2007.


| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **3** | **_Greg Olsen_** | 127   | 80 | 1,073 | 3 | 16 | 9 | 2 |



**4.** **Jordan Reed - Was:** Jordan Reed has an incredible amount of injury and concussion issues, but he is one of the best PPG players at the position. Reed has missed six games in the last two season (which doesn’t sound terrible considering how often he seems to be hurt), and is an injury risk again this season. However, the Washington offense is potent - despite losing DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon in free agency - and the addition of Terrelle Pryor should help alleviate some coverage pressure on Reed. Don’t reach too high for him, but he’s a great tight end to have in fantasy this year.

| **4** | **_Jordan Reed_** | 87   | 66 | 686 | 6 | 12 | 8 | 5 |



**5.** **Jimmy Graham - Sea:** Graham was expected to do great things when he moved over to the Seahawks, but he was a boom or bust player last season. He may be somewhat injury prone and getting older, but still has a chance to be productive in a powerful Seattle offense. Matthew Berry at ESPN noted that Russell Wilson's passing yardage total has increased every season of his career, and Graham should again benefit this season. He quietly had 923 years last year and should come close again this year, and could be a great TE sleeper pick if he can reel in a few more of his 17 red zone targets last season for touchdowns (he had only 4). He’s a great pick at TE after the big 4.

| **5** | **_Jimmy Graham_** | 95   | 65 | 923 | 6 | 17 | 6 | 4 |



**6.** **Tyler Eifert - Cin:** Eifert is a tough player to gauge the fantasy draft value of. He only played 8 games last season, but was a top level tight end in each week he played. When he is healthy, he consistently gets targets and TD opportunities (all five of his touchdowns last season came in the red zone). The addition of John Ross should help to open up opposing defenses a bit, but Eifert is way too big on an injury risk to take early on. He’s worth a fantasy selection as a TE1, but make sure you have a reliable and solid backup.

| **6** | **_Tyler Eifert_** | 47   | 29 | 394 | 5 | 9 | 5 | 5 |



**7.** **Kyle Rudolph - Min:** Kyle Rudolph led all TE’s and all Vikings in targets with 132 last season, and he is a good value here again in 2017. Both offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur and head coach Mike Zimmer love to throw to TE’s, as both have over 20% of their offense’s target share going to TE’s in recent seasons, and look for Rudolph to reap the benefits of that again this season. His red zone usage is his greatest value - he was targeted 24 times from inside the 20. That usage in Minnesota’s slow and conservative offense is well worth selecting in fantasy drafts as a reliable starting tight end.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

**8.** **Delanie Walker - Ten:** The Titans added a ton of firepower this past offseason in the form of Eric Decker and a slew of rookies led by 5th overall pick Corey Davis. He has 333 targets in the last 3 seasons combined, showing a great usage value, and Mariota knows Walker is a reliable target. Despite the uptick in competition for targets, Walker should see enough of them this season to still be a top 10 player at the position.


| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **8** | **_Delanie Walker_** | 102   | 65 | 800 | 7 | 16 | 8 | 5 |



**9.** **Martellus Bennett - GB:** Bennett head up to Wisconsin this offseason to join Green Bay’s already potent passing offense. While Bennett is a great talent, Rodgers has thrown only 17.1 percent of his completions to TE’s since 2014, making Bennett’s role a bit of a scary one for fantasy purposes, but he could be the tight end that breaks that mold if he stays healthy. Bennett gives Rodgers another big target to look for in the end zone, where 5 of his 7 touchdowns came last season. Success for tight ends has been sporadic in Green Bay in recent years, and thus Bennett is merely a high upside pick due to the talent of both him and Rodgers for those who waited to take a starting TE until later in the draft.

| **9** | **_Martellus Bennett_** | 73   | 55 | 701 | 7 | 10 | 8 | 5 |



**10.** **Zach Ertz - Phi:** The entire fantasy world has been waiting on the Ertz breakout tour for quite some time, but the Eagles significantly upgraded the receiving corps this offseason by adding Torrey Smith and Alshon Jeffery. Ertz had 106 targets last season and 58.3 yards per game, which is behind only Kelce, Gronk, and Olsen among TE’s. He’s a sneaky good TE2 this year, with the upside to be a lower level TE1 if he can get some more TD grabs.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **10** | **_Zach Ertz_** | 106   | 78 | 816 | 4 | 14 | 6 | 3 |



**11.** **Eric Ebron - Det:** Ebron averaged 55 yards per game in 2016, but only scored 1 touchdown on the entire season on 86 targets. With Anquan Boldin gone, there are 22 red zone targets from last season now up for grabs in Detroit. Ebron should (hopefully) be able to see some of those, and elevate his game to be a good TE2 and matchup based TE1 in fantasy this season.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **11** | **_Eric Ebron_** | 86   | 61 | 711 | 1 | 6 | 5 | 1 |



**12.** **Hunter Henry - LAC:** Despite Hunter Henry playing second fiddle to Antonio Gates last season, he still put up 478 and 8 touchdowns on a mere 54 targets. He has a ton of target competition in LA with rookie receiver Mike Williams joining an already crowded receiving unit, and Antonio Gates still lurks on the Chargers’ roster. Henry’s potential is great this season, but he shouldn’t be reached for in drafts due to the amount of other people competing for targets from Philip Rivers. Henry is a a solid TE2 this year.


| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **12** | **_Hunter Henry_** | 54   | 36 | 478 | 8 | 16 | 10 | 7 |



**13.** **Jack Doyle - Ind:** Andrew Luck’s love of tight ends is no secret. Over the last three seasons, tight ends have received 25% of Andrew Luck’s completions, 24% of passing yards, and 37% of his TD’s. Mike Clay at ESPN noted that over the past 10 years, the offenses of Colts head coach Chuck Pagano and offensive coordinator Rob Chudzinski have directed a minimum of 20 percent of the targets to the tight end position. Doyle is a popular sleeper target this season - and for good reason. He should blow by his stats from last year as Dwayne Allen is now in New England, and should be a TE1 this year.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **13** | **_Jack Doyle_** | 75   | 59 | 584 | 5 | 12 | 9 | 4 |



**14.** **Coby Fleener - NO:** Fleener was hailed as a disappointment in his first year with the Saints, but he was quietly a top 12 TE while only starting 8 games. He received 81 targets in that span, and Brandin Cooks’ departure could open more targets up. The Saints’ offense is still the best passing offense in the league - over 5,000 yards through the air last season - and Fleener should be a good bounce back candidate if he can stay healthy. He’s a quality TE2 that has some upside due to his offense in New Orleans.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **14** | **_Coby Fleener_** | 82   | 50 | 631| 3 | 16 | 9 | 2 |



**15.** **Jason Witten - Dal:** The aging Witten proved to be a reliable target for rookie Dak Prescott last year, seeing 95 targets and turning them into 673 yards. Witten also had 16 red zone targets last season, an ever important stat when it comes to fantasy tight ends. While he is bound to slow down sometime soon, he will still be relied on in a young Dallas offense, and is a decent TE2, especially in PPR leagues.


| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **15** | **_Jason Witten_** | 95   | 69 | 673 | 3 | 16 | 10 | 2 |



**16.** **Cameron Brate - TB:** Cameron Brate faces significant competition from sensational rookie OJ Howard for snaps at tight end, but proved to be a reliable target for Jameis Winston in 2016. Brate was tops in the NFL in yards per routes run last year, and scored 8 TD’s on 16 red zone targets last season. The other Bucs offseason addition - DeSean Jackson - should take a lot of the deeper passes away from Brate, and OJ Howard should only see his role increase as the season goes on. Brate is a low level TE2, and a risky pick this year with the impending OJ Howard Experience.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **16** | **_Cameron Brate_** | 81   | 57 | 660 | 8 | 16 | 10 | 8 |



**17.** **Julius Thomas - Mia:** Julius Thomas has been an injury prone player throughout his career, having never eclipsed 800 receiving yards in a season. He is great in the red zone - exemplified by 3 of his 4 2016 touchdowns coming from within the 20 - and is now in Miami, undoubtedly a better offense than his former Jacksonville squad. Thomas shouldn’t be relied on as even a reliable TE2, but he does have some upside by returning to an Adam Gase-led offense. He’s got late sleeper appeal.

| Rank  | Player Name  | Targets       | Receptions         | Receiving Yards | Receiving TD’s  | Red Zone Targets  | Red Zone Receptions  | Red Zone Receiving TD's  |

| **17** | **_Julius Thomas_** | 52   | 30 | 281 | 4 | 7 | 4 | 3 |



**18.** **CJ Fiedorowicz - Hou:** Fiedorowicz will (hopefully) benefit from improved quarterback play this season, but that remains to be seen until the first few games of the season. Fiedorowicz saw 89 targets last season (top 10 for TE),  and12 of those were in red zone (more than AJ Green, Julio, B. Cooks). Don’t count on him to carry your fantasy team through the season, but he’s a low end TE2 in a new look offense that could feature him heavily.

| **18** | **_CJ Fiedorowicz_** | 89   | 54 | 559 | 4 | 12 | 6 | 3 |



**19.** **Austin Hooper - Atl:** Hooper is now the starting tight end in Georgia after having a good season last year, and should see highly increased targets because of it. Atlanta has one of the league’s best offenses, and Hooper could benefit greatly from being the sole tight end this season. He’s a great high-upside pick in this year’s fantasy drafts, and worth a late round look.

| **19** | **_Austin Hooper_** | 27   | 19 | 271 | 3 | 5 | 3 | 2 |



**20.** **Antonio Gates - LAC:** The future Hall of Fame saw 18 red zone targets last season (top 12 in all of the NFL) despite seeing less than 100 total targets. Gates will undoubtedly lose time to second year TE Hunter Henry, and target competition from the large group of LAC wide receivers also brings his fantasy value down. Gates is a touchdown or bust player this year, and is a tough, low upside choice in fantasy drafts.

**21.** **OJ Howard - TB:** While rookie tight ends are usually never on the fantasy radar, OJ Howard is a special enough talent to warrant fantasy interest. He is a huge target that can fly (4.51 40 yard dash), and joins a powerful offense where opposing defenses already need to account for Mike Evans and other offseason acquisition DeSean Jackson. Howard could step into a solid role faster than any of us realize, and is well worth a late round selection in fantasy squads for upside alone.

**22.** **David Njoku - Cle:** Another high upside rookie, first round selection David Njoku comes into an immediate role in Cleveland with only second year player Seth DeValve standing in his way. While he shouldn’t be counted on as a reliable fantasy asset, he is a talented receiver and could be set up for a decent role as a rookie in what should be an improved Cleveland offense. He is worth taking a late round look.

**23.** **Jared Cook - Oak:** Jared Cook had 32 targets in GB’s 3 playoff games last season for 230 and 2 TD’s, a good image of what he can do when given opportunities. In Oakland, he gives Carr and Co. a good receiving option at tight end, but should face target competition from incumbent Clive Walford. He’s got some upside, but is best left for leagues that start 2 TE’s.

**24.** **Zach Miller - Chi:** Zach Miller missed 6 games last season, and the Bears drafted rookie Adam Shaheen in the NFL Draft this past April. Glennon will need someone to throw to, and surely the tight end position is in the mix for targets in an offense that will often be playing catch-up later in games. He could get a decent volume of work this season, but he’s merely a fantasy backup this year.

**25.** **Evan Engram - NYG:** Evan Engram is another rookie tight end that could make a splash this season despite the knowledge that the position usually takes time to develop into the NFL game. Engram is a solid receiver already - essentially a slot receiver - and should get some looks despite the presence of Odell Beckham, Sterling Shepard, and newcomer Brandon Marshall. Mike Clay at ESPN noted that during each of coach Ben McAdoo's three seasons with the Giants, at least 19 percent of the team's targets have gone to the tight end. That number should stand pat, if not go up, with a talent like Engram. He could be a solid backup tight end when the season is all said and done.

**26.** **Jesse James - Pit:** Jesse James assumes the Heath Miller-esque tight end role in Pittsburgh that had been known for sporadic target shares until the end zone is within reach. While tight ends and touchdowns go hand in hand for fantasy relevance and significant, James has too many weapons around him competing for targets to be a true threat in fantasy leagues. He could be a nice backup, but don’t rely on James to carry you through the season.

**27.** **Dwayne Allen - NE:** This year’s Martellus Bennett, Dwayne Allen comes to the Patriots to join Rob Gronkowski in the tight ends room. Allen was a top 10 TE last year despite injuries, and Gronk has injury risk himself. Allen has high upside when he is healthy, and is a unique TE handcuff for Gronk and could potentially be a worthy backup in his own right. Keep in mind that Martellus Bennett was top 10 fantasy TE last season from weeks 14-16 when Gronk was hurt.

**28.** **Charles Clay - Buf:** - Charles Clay put up 552 yards last season on 87 targets, and shouldn’t be counted on for much more this season. While the Buffalo offense will surely throw more with Rex Ryan out of the picture, Clay isn’t known for big plays and is fairly reliant (like most tight ends) on the touchdown to stay fantasy relevant. He’s best left to leagues that start 2 tight ends.

**29.** **Vernon Davis - Was:** Davis is valuable as a backup to Jordan Reed in an effective Redskins’ offense, as he put up over 580 yards last season on only 59 targets. He’s worth a late round look in deeper leagues if you need a TE, especially if you have Reed.

**30.** **Tyler Higbee - LAR:** Higbee avoided jail time from his altercation last year, and should play a decent role in the Rams new look offense in 2017. He’s a big and fast target capable of creating severe mismatches, but it remains to be seen how he’ll be utilized and how the Rams offense as a whole can produce. He’s a late round sleeper in fantasy leagues.

**31.** **Vance McDonald - SF:** McDonald could be pushed by rookie George Kittle this season, but as of now is the only experienced TE in San Francisco. He’ll get some looks, but don’t expect too much success here despite a Kyle Shanahan-led offense.

**32.** **Ben Watson - Bal:** Coming off of an Achilles injury, Watson now finds himself as a starting TE of yet another team as he joins the Ravens following Dennis Pitta’s injury. He’s shown potential before, and is worth a bench spot (or as high as a TE2 in PPR leagues) in drafts this year due to Baltimore’s pass heavy offense.

**33.** **Adam Shaheen - Chi:** Shaheen was a small school draft pick this offseason who could be thrown into the fire earlier than expected. Zach Miller and Dion Sims are also present on the roster as of now, but Shaheen could see work as early as a few games into the season. Keep him on your watchlist.

**34.** **Austin Seferian-Jenkins - NYJ:** Seferian-Jenkins starts the season off as the leading Jets tight end, but that’s not exactly enticing for fantasy purposes. Rookie Jordan Leggett will push him hard in the tight ends room, and Seferian-Jenkins is best left alone on draft day in most fantasy leagues.

**35.** **Jermaine Gresham - Ari:** Gresham is the starting tight end in a big passing attack, but the receivers and David Johnson take care of most of the targets here. He had only 61 all of last season, and is best left for only deep fantasy leagues on draft day.

## **_K:_**

**1.** **Stephen Gostkowski - NE:** While the Patriots offense was again elite in NFL terms, Gostkowski did not exactly perform as many would have guessed in fantasy terms. With only 4 attempts of 50 or more yards (and 32 attempts total), his 49 extra point attempts carried him through the season as a reliable kicker as the weeks wound down. That said, the Patriots offense should be even more powerful this season with the additions of Brandin Cooks and Dwayne Allen, and Gostkowski might not be the first kicker off the board as he has been in years past. He’s as close as you’ll ever find to a ‘sleeper’ candidate at the kicker position, but don’t reach for kickers!

| **1** | **_Stephen Gostkowski_** | 27/32   | 2/4 | 46/49 |


**2.** **Justin Tucker - Bal:** Justin Tucker was a dominant kicker in 2016, and his fantasy output exemplified that perfectly. He missed only one field goal on the entire season and also nailed all of his 27 extra point attempts. He had 10 field goal attempts from over 50 yards and made all ten of them, a significant stat from a fantasy standpoint. While the Ravens’ pedestrian offense (T-23rd in red zone attempts per game last season) hinders Tucker’s total point output a bit, they should improve this season. Tucker’s ability to hit 50+ yard kicks with consistency propels him to the top of the kicker draft board.

**3.** **Dan Bailey - Dal:** Dan Bailey is one of the most accurate kickers in history, and should again prove why this season. The Cowboys were on a roll the entire regular season last year, and Bailey was perfect on all 46 of his extra point attempts to help carry him through fantasy games. He was only 27 of 32 on field goals last season and made only 2 of his 6 attempts that were 50 or more yards, but he has a high floor as an accurate kicker on a good offense in a kicker-friendly stadium. Bailey is a reliable investment for fantasy purposes, but don’t expect him to carry your team to victory. He’s a high floor – low ceiling type of kicker in fantasy.

**4.** **Matt Bryant - Atl:** Playing in a dome week in and week out, Matt Bryant was a prime fantasy beneficiary of the Falcons’ juggernaut offense in 2016. He made 56 of his 57 extra point attempts – which is astounding in itself – and was also good for 34 of 37 field goal tries. Opportunity and distance consistency are the two best predictors of kicker success in fantasy, and Bryant has them both, as he was 6-8 from 50 or more yards last season in addition to his high kicking percentages. The Atlanta offense should regress a bit this season, especially with offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan moving onto San Francisco, but Bryant should again find himself in a reliable position as a top level fantasy kicker.

**5.** **Mason Crosby - GB:** Mason Crosby is a talented kicker in his own right, but his home field and lack of field goal volume drop him a bit in preseason fantasy rankings. He attempted only 30 total field goals last season, and only 2 of 50 or more yards. He has a tough job playing in the tundra of Lambeau Field – especially later in the season – but does have one of the top offenses in the NFL to get him into scoring position. Unfortunately for Crosby – and those who drafted him in fantasy last year – those scoring positions turned into 47 extra points instead of more field goals. Regardless, Crosby is a solid kicker to take if you’re one of the last in your league to grab one.

**6.** **Adam Vinatieri - Ind:** The ageless Adam Vinatieri was in a similar spot as Gostkowski last season, in a good offense that was scoring touchdowns more than providing him field goal opportunities. He had 44 extra point attempts and only 31 total field goal attempts, but he does play in a dome (huge bonus) and benefits from a talented Indianapolis offense that averaged 3.3 red zone scoring chances per game last season. Due to both opportunity and a favorable home playing situation, Vinatieri is a solid (and, perhaps most importantly, reliable) kicker for your fantasy team.

**7.** **Cairo Santos - KC:** Santos benefits from a conservative Andy Reid attack that put him in position for 35 field goal tries and 39 extra point attempts last season. He was 8-9 on attempts over 40 yards, but only had two kicks of 50 plus yards last year. That said, the Chiefs have a good defense and solid offense that is sure to get Santos the most valuable stat when it comes to kickers in fantasy – opportunity. While weather can be unreliable down the stretch (i.e. in fantasy playoffs) in Kansas City, Santos remains a reliable fantasy kicker for your squad.

**8.** **Matt Prater - Det:** Matt Prater of the Detroit Lions is a very undervalued fantasy kicker. While he is a boom or bust type of player at the kicker position (somehow), his home stadium, team, and leg power boost him to fantasy relevance on a weekly basis. He was 24 of 29 from within 49 yards last season, but Prater nailed all 7 of his attempts last season of 50 or more yards, has a good offense run by Matthew Stafford to get him into scoring positions, and plays in a dome for at least 8 games per season. If you’re looking for a high ceiling play at kicker and willing to risk a down week every once in a while, Prater could be your guy.

**9.** **Sebastian Janikowski - Oak:** Janikowski has been a popular fantasy kicker for some time, but his trademark deep ball has not been as effective as it was in his prime. He made only 3 of his 8 attempts from beyond 50 yards in 2016, but did hit 10 of 11 kicks from 40-49 yards. A top level Raiders offense is something Janikowski has never had the benefit of, so his attempts on both field goals and extra points will be substantial enough for him to warrant a spot as a back end starter or top level streaming option at kicker this season.

**10.** **Wil Lutz - NO:** Lutz benefits from playing in a dome and with one of the NFL’s best offenses in New Orleans. He had a whopping 50 extra point attempts last year (making 49 of them), and also added in 34 field goals. It’s illogical to predict a repeat of those stats this year, but the Saints’ powerful offense and favorable kicking conditions on a consistent basis keep Lutz relevant as a back end starter at the kicker position.

**11.** **Dustin Hopkins - Was:** As the kicker for a potent Washington offense, Hopkins had an incredible 42 attempts last season to go along with his 39 extra point attempts. He wasn’t very consistent in his league leading 42 attempts, and nailed only 3 of his 7 attempts from 50 or more yards. With Washington’s offense again in a good position to get scoring opportunities (3.8 red zone scoring attempts last season, 6th in the NFL), Hopkins is a lower end fantasy starter at the kicker position. Expect some misses and frustrating weeks, though.

**12.** **Steven Hauschka - Buf:** Hauschka comes to Buffalo after a few seasons in Seattle, where he made 33 of his 37 attempts last season. While the Buffalo offense should improve a bit with defensive-minded Rex Ryan out of the picture, it’s not too reliable (especially later in the season when the weather gets worse) Hauschka’s stats will benefit all that much. He’s a streaming option at kicker this year.

**13.** **Brandon McManus - Den:** McManus benefits from the mile high air in Denver and the unique ability to kick for extra distance in 8 of his 16 games each season. That said, he was only 3 of 6 on 50+ yard attempts last year. He’s got a mediocre offense leading him down the field, but perhaps that’s just what he needs some weeks to get him multiple field goal tries. He’s worth a shot in a 12 team league.

**14.** **Graham Gano - Car:** Gano missed 8 of his 38 kicks last year in a sputtering Carolina offense, but should improve (along with the team as a whole) in 2017. He’s been fairly reliable throughout his career, but that’s not enough to warrant draft day consideration in fantasy. There are options with greater upside here.

**15.** **Chris Boswell - Pit:** Pittsburgh’s kicker faces tough weather and defenses for a decent amount of the season, but the powerful Steelers offense gives Boswell a boost for fantasy relevance. He hit all 36 of his extra point attempts last season, but was just 21 of 25 on his field goal attempts. That number would need to rise for Boswell to become a starting fantasy kicker, but he’s a decent matchup-based streaming option.

**16.** **Blair Walsh - Sea:** After a tough ending to his tenure in Minnesota, Walsh comes to Seattle to kick for a better offense than he’s ever had the pleasure of dealing with. Aside from the chip shot whiff in the playoffs and subsequent struggles, Walsh has been a decent kicker for most of his career and should do fairly well in a potent Seattle offense that averaged 3.8 red zone scoring opportunities per game in 2016 (8th in the league). Walsh is a streaming option until he can prove consistent success in rainy Seattle.

**17.** **Caleb Sturgis - Phi:** Sturgis was right behind Hopkins with 41 field goal attempts last season, and did a decent job with such high volume. The Eagles’ offense should be better this season as Carson Wentz adjusts to the NFL – especially with new additions Alshon Jeffery, Torrey Smith, and LeGarrette Blount – but it’s tough to say whether Sturgis will benefit or falter from this. The Eagles offense will keep Sturgis fantasy relevant in 2017, but perhaps as a streaming play unless the field goal volume stays pat from last season.

**18.** **Josh Lambo - LAC:** The Chargers’ offense added rookie receiver Mike Williams to an already crowded room, and the offense could be a real talent this year with Keenan Allen returning from injury. Lambo could see more than the 32 field goal attempts last year, but he’ll have to improve on his 0 for 3 record on kicks of 50 or more yards last season to be fantasy relevant.

**19.** **Nick Novak - Hou:** Nick Novak’s fantasy value comes from having a kicker friendly stadium in Houston, a dominant defense that can keep opponents off of the field for too long, and an offense that’s not quite good enough to consistently get touchdowns. Regardless of whether Tom Savage or DeShaun Watson is under center this season in Houston, Novak’s stats should be boosted up because of it. He’s a top level streaming option, if not a low-end fantasy starter.

## **_D/ST:_**

**1.** **Denver Broncos D/ST:** The Broncos return the majority of their top level defense this season, and should remain in that tier throughout this one. They forced 27 turnovers and were tied for 3rd in sacks, while allowing only 316.1 yards against per game in 2016 (4th best in the NFL). While it is foolish to use last year’s stats as a predictor for team defense, the Broncos defense has been so consistent the past few years that they can be trusted as again being one of the top fantasy defenses this season. Don’t reach for defenses (take them late!), but if the Broncos happen to still be there after a handful of D/ST’s have gone, might as well scoop them up. Keep in mind, however, that they do have a tough Week 15 and 16 schedule in facing Indianapolis and Washington, in addition to the [toughest strength of schedule in the NFL this season](http://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/234722/2017-nfl-strength-of-schedule).

**2.** **Seattle Seahawks D/ST:** The Seahawks underperformed - by their recent standards - but still allowed the 5th least amount of yards per game last year at 318.7. They had a whopping 42 sacks (T-3rd), and didn’t really lose anyone of note in the offseason. Their 2017 opponents had a combined winning percentage of .455 (T-25th), giving them one of the NFL’s easier schedules, and they have two winnable games in the Jaguars and Rams in Weeks 14 and 15. They do have a tough Dallas offense in Week 16, but expect Seattle’s D/ST to be at least good enough to give you a shot to get there in your fantasy league. Expect another strong season in the Pacific Northwest.

**3.** **Kansas City Chiefs D/ST:** The Chiefs are notable for having a rowdy and difficult stadium to play in for opposing teams, but are also notable for having dynamic return man Tyreek Hill. Hill is a threat every time he touches the ball, and is one of the few special teams guys that gives a legitimate boost to a D/ST for fantasy purposes. In addition to Hill, the Chiefs defense scored 5 touchdowns last season themselves, and is populated with talent throughout from veterans like Tamba Hali to young up and comers like Dee Ford. Don’t rely on last year’s touchdowns to repeat (defensively, at least), but they had 33 forced turnovers last season to go along with 28 sacks. The sacks should increase if the unit remains at full health, but the Chiefs D/ST are a reliable bet to put up top ten numbers throughout the season regardless.

**4.** **Houston Texans D/ST:** JJ Watt’s impending return should help to boost the Texans defense this season, but the loss of emerging corner AJ Bouye could hurt more than the Texans realize. Rookie linebacker Zach Cunningham was a great pick in the draft who could step in and play early on the defense that allowed the least yards per game in the NFL last season. Their points against per game should improve, as the offense should (hopefully) be more effective than last year and not be giving opposing offenses good field position on a weekly basis, but the Texans are a formidable unit even without breakout corner AJ Bouye. Look for JJ Watt and Co. to have another strong fantasy finish this year, especially as they have one of the easier schedules in the league this year (T-27th).

**5.** **Minnesota Vikings D/ST:** The Vikings had a superb 7 touchdowns from their D/ST last season, with 3 coming via special teams. Cordarrelle Patterson’s departure to Oakland hurts that potential a bit, but the defense itself is loaded with talent. The line had 41 sacks last season (5th) and had 27 forced turnovers to add. While the Vikings conservative offense does a good job of holding onto the ball and keeping the defense off the field (12th most time of possession in 2016), the defense does its own job of keeping opposing teams at bay. The Vikings won’t be a sexy pick in drafts this year, but they should be a very effective one.

**6.** **Arizona Cardinals D/ST:** Arizona’s defense gave up only 305.2 yards per game last season, second in the NFL to only the Houston Texans. Add in their league leading 48 sacks, their 14 fumble recoveries (2nd in the NFL), and their 14 interceptions (T-12th), and it is easy to see why the Cardinals have been a reliable D/ST unit for the last few seasons. Patrick Peterson provides them with a shutdown corner that can match up with any receiver in the NFL, and rookie Haasan Reddick could be a wildcard for the Arizona defense this season after his highly productive season at Temple University. The Cardinals once again bring a top level defense to the board, and could be one of the elite groups by the end of the season. Take them with confidence.

**7.** **New England Patriots D/ST:** One of the most under the radar fantasy defenses, the New England Patriots benefit from good coaching and schemes, an offense that kept the ball for an average time of 31:18 each game last season (4th), and a quality group of players that combined for 34 sacks and 23 takeaways last season. The Patriots should again be a top team in the league - with talk of them going 19-0 floating around the media - and their D/ST group should be a top fantasy asset yet again. They are a great pick to lead your team to success, and should be available later than a lot of other top defenses.

**8.** **Carolina Panthers D/ST:** The Carolina Panthers added Captain Munnerlyn, Mike Adams, and Julius Peppers this offseason in an effort to return to their 2015 form when they went to the Super Bowl. They were second in the NFL last season with 47 sacks, but regressed in many other departments last season. While they could be due for improvement this season, their division has improved greatly and they have a tough few games in Weeks 15 and 16 against Green Bay and Tampa Bay. They will get you through the season alright, but don’t rely on the Panthers as your sole D/ST this year. Make sure you have another quality (top-15) unit on your squad.

**9.** **New York Giants D/ST:** The Giants were a surprise D/ST unit last year in the fantasy world, and the emergence of Landon Collins as one of the NFL’s best safeties has given this group a formidable secondary to build around. The Giants should have their hands full with their division and during the fantasy playoffs, with games against Dallas, Philadelphia, and Arizona on tap for Weeks 14-16. They are in a similar boat as the Panthers in that they are a good unit to own, but make sure you have at least one other quality unit on your roster.

**10.** **Jacksonville Jaguars D/ST:** It seems like we have been waiting forever for the Jaguars defense to finally break out, but this may actually be the year. While they only had 13 turnovers on the season, they were 6th best in yards allowed per game, and added veterans Calais Campbell and Barry Church as well as breakout corner AJ Bouye. With the [second easiest strength of schedule in the NFL this season](http://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/234722/2017-nfl-strength-of-schedule), the Jaguars could be an epic sleeper pick if all their finely gathered pieces come together. They also draw the 49ers in Week 16. The Jags are a sleeper pick and quality D/ST2 in nearly any format.

**11.** **Los Angeles Rams D/ST:** The Rams as a whole were a mess last season. While coach Jeff Fisher is out and the Rams have a whole new look, they did lose TJ McDonald this offseason. Connor Barwin might have been their best defensive addition, but that may speak for itself. The Rams are a group that has talent (think Aaron Donald) but minimal upside, as the team as a whole leaves a lot to be desired. They’re a solid group, and are settled in as a D/ST2 this season.

They finished in the top ten in both yards allowed and points allowed last season, and they could do the same this year behind CJ Mosley and company. The addition of Tony Jefferson adds a significant element to their secondary not seen since Ed Reed retired. Expect Baltimore to be a good value on draft day, and worth your pick if you’re one of the last teams to grab a defense.

**13.** **Philadelphia Eagles D/ST:** The Eagles upgraded their defensive line in the first round of the draft by adding Derek Barnett, and also acquired Chris Long and Timmy Jernigan to shore up the front seven. This group should improve on the 34 sacks the Birds had last year, and although the secondary is scary weak, the Eagles should be talented enough on both sides of the ball to keep their opponents at bay throughout a majority of the season. The Eagles are a great defense to use in a tandem with another unit, as they have a relatively tough schedule this year but face the Rams in Week 14 (week one of fantasy playoffs). They’re a great value down this low.

**14.** **Pittsburgh Steelers D/ST:** The Pittsburgh defense was average on many accounts last season, and lost veteran Lawrence Timmons in the offseason. The Steelers did add linebacker TJ Watt in the NFL Draft, and has a potent offense to help in securing and holding onto leads in many games, but the Pittsburgh unit has some vulnerabilities that could be exploited by good offenses. That said, they boast the league’s [5th easiest schedule in the NFL this season](http://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/234722/2017-nfl-strength-of-schedule), but face New England in Week 15. The Steelers D/ST is low upside this season, but still not a bad backup.

**15.** **Cincinnati Bengals D/ST:** The Bengals are a talented defense, averaging only 19.7 points against per game last year (8th) and posting a respectable 33 sacks while also nabbing 17th interceptions on the season (T-4th). While the Bengals play in a historically tough AFC North, they have the [4th easiest schedule in the NFL this season](http://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/234722/2017-nfl-strength-of-schedule), and could be a great value pick. They are a great sleeper and backup this season, and get Bears-Vikings-Lions in Weeks 14-16. Could be much, much worse.

**16.** **Green Bay Packers D/ST:** The Packers defense was an odd fantasy play last season, allowing over 24 points against per game while generating 40 sacks and 25 total turnovers. The Packers benefit from having a world class quarterback in Aaron Rodgers and an offense to go with it, and the defense should improve from last season, but the Packers shouldn’t be relied on to carry your team through a fantasy season. They’re a backup defense this year, but you may want to snag them midway through the season if you are in the playoff hunt. Their final three games are Browns-Panthers-Vikings, offering two very favorable matchups during the fantasy playoffs. They could be a good stash.

**17.** **Los Angeles Chargers D/ST:** Joey Bosa dominated the NFL in his rookie year and is the new face of a relocated Chargers defense that is looking to make its mark. Despite posting mediocre numbers in both points and yards allowed, they did tie for the league lead with 18 interceptions. Turnovers give opportunity for the unpredictable defensive touchdown, and this unit could be a nice sleeper pick among the later defenses to be selected on the season. They’re among the higher-upside backup defenses to own.

**18.** **Oakland Raiders D/ST:** The Raiders are in the middle of a well publicized turnaround, but their offense seems to have been the major catalyst to that success. With over 24 points allowed per game last season and a mere 25 total sacks (dead last in the league), the Raiders need to improve as a whole in order to make that next step. The biggest news here for fantasy purposes is the addition of Cordarrelle Patterson, who has scored 5 kickoff return touchdowns in his 4 year career. The Raiders could fall do to their poor performance last year, but they’re worth a flier as a solid backup defense. Don’t expect top level numbers, however.

They could be a decent backup defense this season due to their improvement as a team overall, but don’t expect a repeat of their 4 defensive touchdowns. The Bucs are a mid-road defensive backup this year.

**20.** **Atlanta Falcons D/ST:** The Falcons defense may have been mediocre last season, but they are an up and coming group that should improve vastly this year. Dontari Poe was a big addition to the middle of the offensive line, but the Falcons have a tough Saints-Buccaneers-Saints schedule during the fantasy playoffs. The vulnerability in crucial situations and average performance across the board leaves the Falcons best served as a backup defense this year, regardless of the widespread talent across the defensive depth chart on paper.

**21.** **Miami Dolphins D/ST:** The Miami defense added Lawrence Timmons and William Hayes this offseason, but still doesn’t pose a major threat to opposing offenses. Allowing over 380 yards per game last season the Dolphins need to improve this year to be relevant in a fantasy sense. Their 25 forced turnovers and 33 sacks are not exactly dominant, and the Dolphins have the [sixth hardest schedule this season according to last year’s winning percentage](http://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/234722/2017-nfl-strength-of-schedule). Consider them barely a backup squad to start the season off for your fantasy team.

Coach Rex Ryan is also gone, and the defense will (presumably) be learning an entirely new system this year. They are a risky pick to repeat on their 39 sacks last season, and may be best left as a streaming option.

They are also a sneaky good defense to have during fantasy playoffs, as they draw the 49ers and Rams in Weeks 15 and 16.

They averaged over 22 points against per game last season to go along with only had 26 sacks - one ahead of the last place Oakland Raiders in the statistic - and also only forced 14 turnovers. Despite playing Chicago in Week 15, the Lions are a risky defensive pick during the draft this year.

Their defensive line is borderline elite, but the rest of the defense has glaring holes that are bound to be exploited. The pedestrian offense on the other side of the ball for the Jets only inhibits the D/ST unit more, and they are best left on the waiver wire to start the season off.

That said, they needed to improve on their 377.9 yards against average last season, as well as their mediocre number of forced turnovers (20 total). The Redskins have a solid offense, but a tough schedule this season, and are best left alone in fantasy drafts.

Barry Church and their two starting corners (Brandon Carr and Morris Claiborne) are all gone, leaving glaring holes in the secondary, and the Cowboys are hoping their offense can keep true to last year’s form - if Ezekiel Elliott can avoid an early suspension. They are a risky pick, and should barely be on the fantasy radar this year.

**31.** **San Francisco 49ers D/ST:** The 49ers may have gotten a great deal with Reuben Foster falling that far down in the NFL Draft, but they averaged a whopping 406.4 yards against per game last season and allowed 30 points per game. They are not exactly an ideal fantasy unit, and shouldn’t be on your radar in most drafts.

**32.** **Cleveland Browns D/ST:** While the Browns improved significantly this offseason, they shouldn’t be on the fantasy radar until they prove otherwise. With 13 total fired turnovers and 26 sacks last season, the new defense under Gregg Williams needs to find their form before being considered for fantasy purposes.

## **_DL:_**


**1.** **JJ Watt - Hou:** The otherworldly JJ Watt is returning (allegedly) healthy this season, and should compete for the NFL sack leader if he stays that way throughout the year’s entirety. He had at least 17.5 sacks in 3 of 4 seasons from 2012 to 2015 before missing most of the 2016 season to injury, but he is a top candidate to dominate the league again this year. He could be the first defensive player off the board in IDP leagues, and rightfully so.

**2.** **Khalil Mack - Oak:** Khalil Mack, depending on the platform your league uses, could be a dual position player this season. While that is reliant on your site and the owners that be in such, what is not reliant on that is Mack’s on field production. He gets high numbers of both tackles and sacks, and is present on both running and passing downs. He is easily a top DL if eligible, but still a starting LB in IDP leagues.

**3.** **Jason Pierre-Paul - NYG:** JPP was a hot story in the 2015 offseason, but has continued his reign as a powerful lineman in the NFL with 7 sacks and 24 QB hurries last season. He remains the face of the defensive line in New York, and a viable candidate for double digit sacks again this year.

**4.** **Joey Bosa - LAC:** Second year Joey Bosa had a massively effective rookie year in which he compiled 10.5 sacks despite not playing a full 16 game season. The Chargers’ defense is an up and coming unit that has potential for solid QB pressure on an every down basis, thus bolstering Bosa’s ranking as a pass rusher. He could surprise many this season by even improving on his already astounding rookie year, but it would be a success for him to even match it. He is a DL1, no doubt.

**5.** **Olivier Vernon - NYG:** Olivier Vernon lines up opposite JPP along the Giants front, and was successful in both the sacks and tackles department last season. He has had at least 60 total tackles in 3 of the last 4 seasons while also accumulating 34 sacks in that span. He’s a low end DL1 due to his high floor.

**6.** **Lorenzo Alexander - Buf:** Lorenzo Alexander may or may not be designated for a DL eligible spot in your fantasy league, but if he is, he is worth fantasy gold. A breakout candidate last year despite his veteran status, Alexander had 12.5 sacks and over 70 total tackles. If your league allows Alexander as a DL eligible player, he is a DL1 all day - especially if your league counts tackles.

**7.** **Danielle Hunter - Min:** Danielle Hunter broke out in a big way last season, with 56 total tackles and 12.5 sacks to his name last year. Jim McCormack at ESPN noted that Hunter led all players with at least 500 snaps in sacks per snap last season, and this stat only helps his fantasy value. Hunter has double digit sack potential on a stout Vikings defense, and could improve on his other stats to boot. He’s a DL2 with a lot of upside.

**8.** **Vic Beasley, Jr. - Atl:** Vic Beasley was among the major breakout players on the defensive side of the ball in 2016. He amassed a whopping 15.5 sacks, and added 6 forced fumbles to the mix as he made his presence known on the Atlanta defensive front. With an improved Atlanta defense this year - including first round pick Tak McKinley - Beasley could again wreak havoc for the Falcons as a top level DL1. He’s a sleeper pick going this low at the position.

**9.** **Jadeveon Clowney - Hou:** Jadeveon Clowney could break out in a big way this year, and it could pay big fantasy dividends if he is eligible for a DL spot in your IDP league After only 6 sacks and 18 QB hurries all of last season, a healthy JJ Watt and the addition of rookie linebacker Zach Cunningham could take enough blocking attention away from Clowney to make him a force in the sack department. Houston’s defense as a whole should improve with Watt coming back to full strength, but that alone makes Clowney a low level DL1 with upside. This could be the year we finally see the emergence of the 2014 first overall pick come through in the sack column.

**10.** **Aaron Donald - LAR:** The rare fantasy asset at defensive tackle, Donald has had at least 8 sacks and 47 tackles in each of his three seasons in the NFL. He won’t blow you out of the water with his numbers due to his position, but is still as reliable as they come on the defensive front in fantasy leagues. He’s a reliable DL2 with a high floor and low ceiling.

**11.** **Calais Campbell - Jac:** Calais Campbell was a major offseason signing for the Jaguars this season, as he brings a veteran presence to an up and coming defense down in Florida. While he has never had a double digit sack season in his entire career, Campbell is a reliable tackle/sack combo lineman in fantasy that will surely keep your team afloat. He’s a reliable DL2 when it comes to fantasy purposes.

**12.** **Carlos Dunlap - Cin:** With at least 7.5 sacks in every season since 2013, Carlos Dunlap is a reliable DL to own in fantasy. He is also usually a good bet for 50 plus tackles (3 of the last 4 seasons, last season he had 49), and is also adept at batting down balls if your league counts passes defended (15 last season). He’s a rock solid DL2.

**13.** **Cameron Jordan - NO:** Jordan has had at least 7.5 sacks every season since 2012, and is a formidable pass rusher that all teams need to prepare for offensively. While the rest of the Saints defense leaves much to be desired, Jordan is a fairly reliable target as a lineman for fantasy purposes. He likely won’t hit double digit sacks, but he’ll get close enough and get enough tackles to compete at the position. He’s a low end DL1 for fantasy purposes.

**14.** **Everson Griffen - Min:** Griffen has 30.5 sacks in the last three seasons combined, and is right at home on a good defensive line in Minnesota. He has also had 44 tackles or more in each of the last 3 seasons, and is a reliable lineman to add to your fantasy squad this year.

**15.** **Muhammad Wilkerson - NYJ:** Wilkinson has been up and down in his sack totals over the last few seasons, but the Jets line is populated with talent and should be tough to block for opposing offensive lines. Wilkerson has made at least 56 tackles each season since 2012, and has had two double digit sack seasons in the past four. He’s a good bounce back candidate for sacks and a reliable candidate for tackles as a sleeper DL2.

**16.** **Leonard Williams - NYJ:** Part of the stacked Jets defensive line, Wiliams is an interior lineman and thus difficult to rely on for big fantasy weeks. What he is reliable for is a consistent number of tackles to go along with the occasional sack. If your league counts tackles significantly/individually, he’s a DL2. Otherwise, you’re fishing for sacks here.

**17.** **Ndamukong Suh - Mia:** Suh is another disruptive interior lineman who is reliable enough to become fantasy relevant. He’s had 133 tackles in his 2 seasons in Miami, and 11 sacks to go along with it. He’s a reliable DL2 despite his position.

**18.** **DeForest Buckner - SF:** Buckner is an intriguing interior line prospect who could take a big step forward in 2017. He had 73 tackles in his rookie year to go along with 6 sacks, and the addition of Solomon Thomas only adds to his value as now opposing lines have to pick which one to block. Buckner could take a big step forward this year, and is a sleeper DL2 with upside.

While Detroit’s defense shouldn’t exactly be otherworldly, look for Ansah to hit with 7 or more sacks again this year. He’s a good bounce back candidate and great value for your DL as such a low pick after his down year.

He’s got 12 total sacks in his two NFL season, and is a popular IDP pick this year to improve on those numbers. He’s a DL2.

**24.** **Sheldon Richardson - NYJ:** Sheldon Richardson is a reliable source of tackles on the defensive line, so take note of that if your league scores them with any measure of significance.  He’s had 62 or more tackles in 3 of his 4 seasons, but can’t be relied on for too many sacks (18 in four years). In tackle heavy leagues, he’s a DL2.

Alongside Ndamukong Suh in Miami, Wake is a tough guy to block and has had at least 7 sacks in every season since 2010. He hasn’t had more than 40 tackles since 2012, but his sacks make him a quality backup DL in most fantasy formats.

He has had 20 sacks and 74 tackles in the last two seasons combined, and is thus a reliable bench player in many IDP formats - although it is rare he gets you double digits.

That said, it’s tough to rely on him unless you are sure he is DL eligible for your fantasy league. If he is, he’s a DL2 due to tackles. If he’s only LB eligible, he’s not worth selecting

His low number of total tackles is concerning (over 40 over once in a season since 2010), but sacks are Avril’s main point producers in fantasy. He’s a boom or bust DL2.

**39.** **Ahmad Brooks - SF:** Brooks has had 6 or more sacks in each of the last 6 seasons, and hit the 50 tackles plateau as well for the 49ers in 2016. He’s a good value this low, but don’t expect him to become an every week DL2.

## **_LB:_**

**1.** **Kwon Alexander - TB:** With 145 tackles last season Kwon Alexander became a solid centerpiece of the Tampa Bay defense. He should get better in his 3rd NFL season this year, and he is a top LB1 to take in fantasy drafts.

**2.** **Luke Kuechly - Car:** Kuechly is a tackle machine, but cannot be relied on for much more than that. That said, the amount of tackles he gets (153 or more in 3 of his 5 seasons) makes him a top fantasy LB. A solid 9+ a week from tackles alone is more than enough to ask for your starting linebacker.

**3.** **Bobby Wagner - Sea:** Bobby Wagner exploded for 167 combined tackles last season, and added 4.5 sacks to that number to propel himself into relevance for IDP linebackers. He’s now a top option at the core of a tough Seattle defense, and his tackles alone make him startle each week. He’s a quality LB1.

**4.** **Alec Ogletree - LAR** Ogletree had 136 tackles last season, and will be a main part of the Rams defense again this season. He’s only got 3.5 sacks and 5 interceptions on his career, so the tackles are what provide Ogletree’s main value. He is a high end LB2 this year in most formats.

**5.** **Telvin Smith - Jac:** Telvin Smith has recorded over 100 tackles in all three seasons he has been in the NFL. He’s also recorded 5.5 sacks and 4 interceptions in that span - including 8 passes defended last year alone - to show that he’s not just a tackle-reliant linebacker. He’s got good upside in an up and coming Jaguars defense, and comes into the season as a good LB2.

**6.** **Jamie Collins - Cle:** Collins steps into a major role in the Cleveland defense, and should put up good numbers as an every down linebacker. The Browns defense could be on the field more than they’d like, and Collins will be in the middle of every play. He’s an LB1 in fantasy this season.

**7.** **CJ Mosley - Bal:** Mosley had 92 tackles last season, but his 4 interceptions are what set him apart from many other linebackers. He won’t light up the stat sheet, as his most productive season tackle-wise was his rookie year in 2014 and his numbers overall have decreased by the season, but he’s a reliable bench linebacker who will be on the field for almost every down, and provides opportunity for the unpredictable defensive touchdowns via his passing game prowess.

**9.** **Ryan Shazier - Pit:** Shazier could be one of those players who is better on the field than on the stat sheet, as he has had mediocre numbers of both tackles, sacks, and other stats in past seasons. One aspect Shazier does offer upside is on passing downs, where he had 3 interceptions and 9 passes defended last year. Turnovers are opportunities for the sporadic and elusive defensive touchdown, so Shazier is a high upside pick as an LB1, but makes a top level LB2.

**10.** **Bernardrick McKinney - Hou:** McKinney could be in line for a big role this season in a powerful Texans defense, as he exploded for 129 tackles and 5 sacks at the linebacker position last year in his second NFL season. His sack numbers last year provide good upside for McKinney in 2017, and he is a solid LB2 due to that and his tackle numbers.

**11.** **Vontaze Burfict - Cin:** Burfict has put up some phenomenal seasons in Cincinnati, but he is quite injury prone - not playing a full season since 2013 and playing a total of 26 games in those 3 seasons. While he’s got potential to be a top level fantasy linebacker, you may want to look at someone a little more reliable that early. That said, he’s still an LB1.

**12.** **Christian Kirksey - Cle:** Kirksey is a wildly talented linebacker, but his 148 tackles last season were partly his talent and partly the Browns being on defense so often (2nd lowest average time of possession in the NFL). His impending move to the weak side in the new Browns defense also gives him different types of opportunities, but look for him to still be a solid LB2 in most fantasy formats.

**13.** **Deion Jones - Atl:** Second year player Deion Jones should improve on an already solid rookie campaign that saw him notch 108 tackles and 11 passes defended to go along with his 3 interceptions. He’s a rare linebacker that can make plays on the ball as well as consistently make tackles, and is a high upside LB2 in fantasy leagues this year.

**14.** **Lavonte David - TB:** Last season was a sporadic down season for David, who had recorded at least 139 tackles in each of his first four NFL seasons prior to 2016. While he did still have 5 sacks last year, his tackle totals plummeted, and Kwon Alexander emerged as a force in his own right to take those opportunities away from David. Regardless, David is a great bounce back candidate this year at LB, and should perform way closer to his usual numbers than last year’s poor showing (by his standards), and is a sleeper LB2.

**15.** **Eric Kendricks - Min:** Kendricks has 6.5 sacks in his first two years in the league, and his 109 tackles last year was an improvement from his already good season in his rookie year where he had 92. Kendricks should prove to be a good fantasy play again this season, and his 9 passes defended reflect his ability to make plays on the ball and provide extra opportunities for fantasy points. He’s a high upside LB2 this year.

**16.** **Mark Barron - LAR:** Barron’s had at least 116 tackles in each of the last two seasons, and his experience as a safety helps him significantly in the pass game as he had 8 passes defended last season. He’s not a starter after moving to linebacker, but his increased production has warranted him worthy of a roster spot in IDP formats.

**17.** **Zach Brown - Was:** Zach Brown put up a staggering 149 tackles in his only year in Buffalo last season, with 4 sacks to go along with it. The tackles are what got him a contract in Washington, where he hopes to repeat his success. Don’t rely on that for fantasy purposes, however, as there are plenty of other more reliable options out there at linebacker who aren’t learning a new defense for the second year in a row. Consider him a top level LB2 in IDP formats.

**19.** **Jatavis Brown - LAC:** Brown had 3.5 sacks and 79 tackles as a rookie last season, and joins the other young members of a Chargers defense looking to make a name for itself. He could have some upside, and his 6 passes defended implies that he can make plays on the ball, but Brown is left as a low end LB2 until he can demonstrate consistency.

He had at least 143 tackles in 4 straight season from 2011-2015, and could get close to that number again this season. He is all over the field when healthy, and is a LB2/borderline LB1 pick in fantasy leagues for 2017.

Bobby Wagner is the main feature of the Seattle defense at the linebacker position, but Wright can hold his own and then some. Wright is a low level LB2 in fantasy this year.

He was then traded to Philadelphia, where he underperformed, and then came to Miami last year where he had a decent season. He’s a good sleeper pick this low, but don’t rely on him as a starter for fantasy purposes until he can prove consistency.

**24.** **Derrick Johnson - KC:** Johnson is part of an aging yet effective Chiefs defense, but is still a reliable linebacker in a season where he will turn 35 in November. In fantasy purposes, however, he’s a bench linebacker due to the plethora of other options available. Don’t reach for him, but he’s definitely worthy of a roster spot.

While he will still be a factor in the defense and should still rack up a good amount of tackles, it may be best to rely on someone who will be more of a defensive centerpiece at the LB position for your fantasy team.

He was hailed as a generational talent during the prelude to this year’s NFL Draft, and comes into a 49ers defense known for churning out linebackers. He’s a high upside sleeper pick coming off of his injury, but don’t count on him to start every week off the bat.

The Arizona defense should be solid as a whole, and Bucannon could put up reliable numbers, but he’s nothing more than a bench player in IDP formats this year.

Hicks is an intriguing play who could improve again this year, and his awareness in the passing game between his interceptions and passes defended gives him ample opportunity to secure valuable and unpredictable defensive scoring opportunities. He’s a sleeper bench pick at LB this year.

Miller has recorded at least 11 sacks in 5 of his 6 seasons, one of those an 18.5 sack outburst back in 2012. He is arguably the best sack artist in the NFL, and if he counts as a dual DL/LB, his value shoots way higher than this. As a sole LB, he’s still worth a roster spot due to the sack upside he brings.

**39.** **Reggie Ragland - Buf:** Reggie Ragland had extremely high hopes as a rookie, but tore his ACL during training camp and missed his entire rookie season. He steps into a new look Bills defense under new coach Sean McDermott, and is a good sleeper pick this season. Don’t rely on him as any more than a bench player on draft day, however.

**40.** **Justin Houston - KC:** Justin Houston is a Von Miller-esque type of linebacker in fantasy, as he’s never had 70 total tackles in a season in his 6 years in the NFL. He has, however, put up double digit sack numbers in three of those six - including a 22 sack explosion in 2014. He’s coming off a partial season (5 games) due to injury, but he’s only 28 and still capable of putting up huge sack totals. He’s a great sleeper pick this low and definitely worth a LB roster spot.

**41.** **Darron Lee- NYJ:** Lee enters his second year after playing a fairly decent role for the Jets last year. He recorded 73 tackles and a sack, and should improve on both numbers this season. The Jets defense should be on the field a lot, giving him more opportunity to get points, but don’t rely on him as a starter this year.

## **_DB:_**


**1.** **Landon Collins - NYG:** Collins is hands down the best DB in IDP formats. With a ridiculous 237 tackles in his first two seasons in the NFL, he added 4 sacks and 5 interceptions (as well as 13 passes defended) to his repertoire this past year. He could be the first defensive player off the board in some IDP drafts, and may be worth it.

**2.** **Keanu Neal - Atl:** Neal was thrust into a prime role as a rookie, and he performed admirably with 106 tackles and 8 passes defended. The Falcons’ defense as a whole should take a step forward this year, and Neal could be at the forefront of that improvement. He’s a DB1 this year due to his upside and already established role.

**3.** **Harrison Smith - Min:** Harrison Smith has been a solid IDP selection since he came into the NFL in 2012, and his 91 tackles last year only cements that status. He could be going higher than this ranking, and his 7.5 sacks and 12 interceptions over his 5 seasons gives him DB1 upside. He’s got an extremely high floor among DB’s, and should be taken with confidence.

**4.** **Johnathan Cyprien - Ten:** Cyprien moves from the Jaguars to the Titans this offseason, and joins a Tennessee unit that could be ready to take a big step forward this year behind an already potent offense. Cyprien has had at least 103 tackles in each of his first four seasons, and is a surefire DB1 in fantasy leagues this year.

**5.** **Tony Jefferson - Bal:** Jefferson moves from an already successful role in Arizona to a historically fruitful (for fantasy purposes) role in Baltimore. jefferson had 96 combined tackles last season, and is a threat in the sack department as well with two in each of the last two seasons. He’s a solid DB1 that could fit nicely into his new defense that faces 2017 opponents who last year had a [combined winning percentage of .471%](http://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/234722/2017-nfl-strength-of-schedule).

**6.** **Morgan Burnett - GB:** The veteran Burnett should again play a big role in the Packers’ defense this season, and his IDP value also holds as he continued strong with another 93 tackles last season. He added 2 interceptions, 3 sacks, and an incredible 29 passes defended. Those stats make him a high end DB2 with DB1 upside.

**7.** **Reshad Jones - Mia:** Jones missed most of the season last year, but is still a top IDP defensive back whenever he is healthy. He is a rare find that can perform in the tackle, sack, and interception departments, and should step back into his role as a mainstay on the Dolphins defense. He’s a top DB again this year.

**8.** **Barry Church - Jac:** Veteran Barry Church jumped ship from a Dallas Cowboys team that made the playoffs last season to a Jacksonville squad that is still waiting to break out. The defense in front of him, however, could actually do it this year. The Jaguars are finally putting pieces together, and perhaps Church and his 434 tackles in the last 4 seasons could be the glue that holds it all together. He’s a DB1 in IDP fantasy formats.

**9.** **TJ Ward - Den:** TJ Ward has been another reliable IDP selection since he came into the league with (surprisingly) Cleveland back in 2010. Last season in Denver he had a solid 87 tackles, and his sack numbers are also solid for a DB since coming to the Rockies (5 in 3 seasons). Ward is a reliable DB2 for fantasy purposes.

**10.** **Ha Ha Clinton-Dix - GB:** Clinton-Dix is an underrated IDP player, having never had less than 80 tackles in a season and with 4.5 sacks and 8 interceptions to go on his 3 year NFL career. Five of those interceptions came last year, exemplifying his improvement in the passing game, and he should be considered a prime sleeper pick at the DB position, especially this low. He has DB2 upside.

**11.** **Kurt Coleman - Car:** Coleman has had over 90 tackles in each of his 2 seasons in Carolina, and added 11 interceptions in that time span to boot. The Panthers’ defense should be improved from their struggle last season, and Coleman should be a solid candidate to repeat his performance from the past two seasons. He’s a high upside DB2.

**12.** **Eric Weddle - Bal:** Weddle had 89 tackles and 4 interceptions in his first year in Baltimore, and is now joined by Tony Jefferson at the safety position in what should form a formidable duo. Weddle also had 4 interceptions and 13 passed defended last year, giving him potential for opportunities to make plays on the ball. He’s a high upside DB2 in fantasy.

**13.** **Kenny Vaccaro - NO:** Vaccaro has been a reliable fantasy DB in his career, but last season his tackles dropped from 104 to 68. He is still a centerpiece of the Saints defense, but he’ll need to show a bit of improvement to justify such a high ranking at the position. He’s a reliable DB2 in 2017.

**14.** **Karl Joseph - Oak:** Joseph was thrust into a big role last season in Oakland as a rookie, and he performed quite well. The Raiders defense as a whole is nothing to write home about (save for Khalil Mack), but Joseph is a rising star on that side of the ball. While he shouldn’t post top numbers this year, expect his stats last year to improve with more experience and for him to be a solid DB2 this season.

**15.** **Eric Berry - KC:** Berry had a great season last year, scoring two touchdowns and returning a two point conversion for a score. While it can’t be relied on for those numbers to repeat, Berry should be relied on to have a good amount of tackles this season, as well as some interceptions. He’s a reliable DB2 for fantasy this year.

**16.** **Kam Chancellor - Sea:** Chancellor is more of a big name safety than a stat sheet hog in fantasy football, but nonetheless he is still reliable player to have on your roster. He has had 100 or more total tackles just once in his 7 year career (2012), but still provides enough awareness to be relevant as a low level DB1 in fantasy, but be sure you don’t overdraft him.

**17.** **Logan Ryan - Ten:** Logan Ryan moves from the Patriots to the Titans this offseason after a few productive years in New England. While his position as a cornerback restricts him from true fantasy value, he has had 166 tackles in the last two seasons combined to go along with 6 interceptions. Ryan is one of the few cornerbacks worth rostering in IDP leagues.

He also had 8 interceptions in that span, and brings a versatility to the table that is tough to find in many DB’s for fantasy purposes. He’s got DB2 upside.

**20.** **Antoine Bethea - Ari:** The veteran Bethea had 110 tackles last season, which alone brings him fantasy value. He also moved to the Cardinals this offseason to (presumably) take over the role left by Tony Jefferson - a top fantasy DB last year. Look for Bethea to be a high upside DB2 despite his draft position.

**21.** **Tyrann Mathieu - Ari:** Mathieu was previously an IDP darling with his 89 tackles and 5 interceptions in 2015, but his injury last year derailed him and dropped him down many redraft rankings. It should be noted, however, that he has 9 interceptions in only 4 seasons to go along with 230 tackles. He’s well worth rostering in IDP leagues, as his upside is quite large.

**22.** **Su’a Cravens - Was:** Su’a Cravens played mostly linebacker last season, but was moved back to his natural position this offseason - safety. He should see a significant uptick in production, as his time at linebacker could help him see the field a little bit differently as a safety, and his fantasy stock could rise due to it. He’s a good late round flier as a sleeper pick at DB.

He should see another year with a big role in the Detroit secondary, but don’t reach for him especially high. He’s a reliable back-end DB2.

**24.** **Bashaud Breeland - Was:** Corners are risky to own in fantasy due to their boom or bust nature and (usually) low tackle totals, but Breeland has 154 tackles in his last 2 seasons combined along with 5 interceptions. He’s one of the few roster-able ones, but offers minimal upside.

**26.** **Jahleel Addae - LAC** Addae has played a role on the Chargers defense since his rookie season in 2013, but he leaves a lot to be desired as a fantasy asset. He’s only once gotten more than 50 total tackles in a season (2015, when he had 65), and had 3 sacks to go along with 1 career interception (that he did return for a touchdown). Addae is part of an up and coming defense in Los Angeles, but shouldn’t be trusted as a low ceiling DB2 in fantasy formats.

With less than 80 tackles in each of his 4 pro seasons, Reid is best left on the bench for fantasy purposes.

His 88 tackles last season are a good sign of things to come, but Jones is a bench DB until he becomes more consistent.

Despite that, he is a low end DB2 in fantasy due to the (relative) depth at the position this year.

He could start immediately, and step into a relevant fantasy role before we all know it. He’s worth a late round flier over many other bench spot cornerbacks.

He had 63 tackles to go along with 16 passes defended, but don’t rely on those numbers to necessarily repeat in a totally new defense. He’s a bench player due to the versatility at the CB position in fantasy scoring.

That said, he steps into a role in Buffalo where he figures to be an every down starter in the secondary, and could see his production rise largely above his current draft stock. He’s a good bench candidate this year.

If your league counts return points, Peppers should skyrocket up this ranking to a DB2, as he is also a good bet to start at safety in an up and coming Browns defense.

**40.** **Ricardo Allen - Atl:** With 159 tackles in only 2 pro seasons, Allen could be ranked higher than his current position. However, his limited sample size could be inflated due to the weak Falcons defense. While he should improve again this year, he’s still no more than a bench DB in fantasy.
